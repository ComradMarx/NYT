        Google's employees were shocked when they learned in March that the South Korean consumer electronics giant Samsung was considering replacing Google with Microsoft's Bing as the default search engine on its devices.For years, Bing had been a search engine also-ran. But it became a lot more interesting to industry insiders when it recently added new artificial intelligence technology.Google's reaction to the Samsung threat was "panic," according to internal messages reviewed by The New York Times. An estimated $3 billion in annual revenue was at stake with the Samsung contract. An additional $20 billion is tied to a similar Apple contract that will be up for renewal this year.A.I. competitors like the new Bing are quickly becoming the most serious threat to Google's search business in 25 years, and in response, Google is racing to build an all-new search engine powered by the technology. It is also upgrading the existing one with A.I. features, according to internal documents reviewed by The Times.The new features, under the project name Magi, are being created by designers, engineers and executives working in so-called sprint rooms to tweak and test the latest versions. The new search engine would offer users a far more personalized experience than the company's current service, attempting to anticipate users' needs.Lara Levin, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement that "not every brainstorm deck or product idea leads to a launch, but as we've said before, we're excited about bringing new A.I.-powered features to search, and will share more details soon."Billions of people use Google's search engine every day for everything from finding restaurants and directions to understanding a medical diagnosis, and that simple white page with the company logo and an empty bar in the middle is one of the most widely used web pages in the world. Changes to it would have a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people, and until recently it was hard to imagine anything challenging it.Google has been worried about A.I.-powered competitors since OpenAI, a San Francisco start-up that is working with Microsoft, demonstrated a chatbot called ChatGPT in November. About two weeks later, Google created a task force in its search division to start building A.I. products, said two people with knowledge of the efforts, who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.Modernizing its search engine has become an obsession at Google, and the planned changes could put new A.I. technology in phones and homes all over the world.The Samsung threat represented the first potential crack in Google's seemingly impregnable search business, which was worth $162 billion last year. Although it was not clear whether Microsoft's work with A.I. was the main reason Samsung was considering a change after the last 12 years, that was the assumption inside Google. The contract is under negotiation, and Samsung could stick with Google.But the idea that Samsung, which makes hundreds of millions of smartphones with Google's Android software every year, would even consider switching search engines shocked Google's employees.After some workers were told that the company was looking for volunteers this month to help put together material for a pitch to Samsung, they reacted with emojis and surprise. "Wow, OK, that's wild," one person responded.A Google spokesperson said that the company was continuously improving its search engine to give users and partners more reason to choose Google, and that Android phone makers were free to embrace technologies from different companies to improve their users' experience.Samsung and Microsoft declined to comment.Google has been doing A.I. research for years. Its DeepMind lab in London is considered one of the best A.I. research centers in the world, and the company has been a pioneer with A.I. projects, such as self-driving cars and the so-called large language models that are used in the development of chatbots. In recent years, Google has used large language models to improve the quality of its search results, but held off on fully adopting A.I. because it has been prone to generating false and biased statements.Now the priority is winning control of the industry's next big thing. Last month, Google released its own chatbot, Bard, but the technology received mixed reviews.Plans for the new search engine, which demonstrate Google's ambitions to reimagine the search experience, are still in the early stages, with no clear timetable on when it will release the new search technology.The system would learn what users want to know based on what they're searching when they begin using it. And it would offer lists of preselected options for objects to buy, information to research and other information. It would also be more conversational - a bit like chatting with a helpful person.But long before the search engine can be rebuilt, the Magi project will add features to the existing search engine, according to internal documents. Google has more than 160 people working full time on it, a person with knowledge of the work said.Magi would keep ads in the mix of search results. Search queries that could lead to a financial transaction, such as buying shoes or booking a flight, for example, would still feature ads on their results pages.That's important for Google, since search ads are the primary way it makes money. Its chatbot, Bard, does not feature ads, and there has been anticipation in the tech industry that A.I. answers on search engines could make ads less relevant to users.The planned search additions could also answer questions about software coding and write code based on a user's request. Google may place an ad under the computer code answers, according to a document.Last week, Google invited some employees to test Magi's features, and it has encouraged them to ask the search engine follow-up questions to judge its ability to hold a conversation. Google is expected to release the tools to the public next month and add more features in the fall, according to the planning document.The company plans to initially release the features to a maximum of one million people. That number should progressively increase to 30 million by the end of the year. The features will be available exclusively in the United States.Google has also explored efforts to let people use Google Earth's mapping technology with help from A.I. and search for music through a conversation with a chatbot, a Google director wrote in a document.Other product ideas are in various stages of development. A tool called GIFI would use A.I. to generate images in Google Image results. Another tool, Tivoli Tutor, would teach users a new language through open-ended A.I. text conversations.Yet another product, Searchalong, would let users ask a chatbot questions while surfing the web through Google's Chrome browser. People might ask the chatbot for activities near an Airbnb rental, for example, and the A.I. would scan the page and the rest of the internet for a response.Jim Lecinski, a former Google vice president of sales and service, said the company had been goaded into action and now had to convince users that it was as "powerful, competent and contemporary" as its competitors."If we are the leading search engine and this is a new attribute, a new feature, a new characteristic of search engines, we want to make sure that we're in this race as well," Mr. Lecinski, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University, said in an interview.

        When the Supreme Court declared a constitutional right to same-sex marriage nearly eight years ago, social conservatives were set adrift.The ruling stripped them of an issue they had used to galvanize rank-and-file supporters and big donors. And it left them searching for a cause that - like opposing gay marriage - would rally the base and raise the movement's profile on the national stage."We knew we needed to find an issue that the candidates were comfortable talking about," said Terry Schilling, the president of American Principles Project, a social conservative advocacy group. "And we threw everything at the wall."What has stuck, somewhat unexpectedly, is the issue of transgender identity, particularly among young people. Today, the effort to restrict transgender rights has supplanted same-sex marriage as an animating issue for social conservatives at a pace that has stunned political leaders across the spectrum. It has reinvigorated a network of conservative groups, increased fund-raising and set the agenda in school boards and state legislatures.The campaign has been both organic and deliberate, and has even gained speed since Donald J. Trump, an ideological ally, left the White House. Since then, at least 20 states, all controlled by Republicans, have enacted laws that reach well beyond the initial debates over access to bathrooms and into medical treatments, participation in sports and policies on discussing gender in schools.About 1.3 million adults and 300,000 children in the United States identify as transgender. These efforts have thrust them, at a moment of increased visibility and vulnerability, into the center of the nation's latest battle over cultural issues."It's a strange world to live in," said Ari Drennen, the L.G.B.T.Q. program director for Media Matters, a liberal media monitoring group that tracks the legislation. As a transgender woman, she said, she feels unwelcome in whole swaths of the country where states have attacked her right "just to exist in public."The effort started with a smattering of Republican lawmakers advancing legislation focused on transgender girls' participation in school sports. And it was accelerated by a few influential Republican governors who seized on the issue early.But it was also the result of careful planning by national conservative organizations to harness the emotion around gender politics. With gender norms shifting and a sharp rise in the number of young people identifying as transgender, conservative groups spotted an opening in a debate that was gaining attention."It's a sense of urgency," said Matt Sharp, the senior counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom, an organization that has provided strategic and legal counsel to state lawmakers as they push through legislation on transgender rights. The issue, he argued, is "what can we do to protect the children?"Mr. Schilling said the issue had driven in thousands of new donors to the American Principles Project, most of them making small contributions.The appeal played on the same resentments and cultural schisms that have animated Mr. Trump's political movement: invocations against so-called "wokeness," skepticism about science, parental discontent with public schools after the Covid-19 pandemic shutdowns and anti-elitism.Nadine Smith, the executive director of Equality Florida, a group that fights discrimination against L.G.B.T.Q. people, said there was a direct line from the right's focus on transgender children to other issues it has seized on in the name of "parents' rights" - such as banning books and curriculums that teach about racism."In many ways, the trans sports ban was the test balloon in terms of how they can frame these things," she said. "Once they opened that parents' rights frame, they began to use it everywhere."For now, the legislation has advanced almost exclusively in Republican-controlled states: Those same policies have drawn strong opposition from Democrats who have applauded the increased visibility of transgender people - in government, corporations and Hollywood - and policies protecting transgender youths.The 2024 presidential election appears poised to provide a national test of the reach of this issue. The two leading Republican presidential contenders, Mr. Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who has not officially declared a bid, have aggressively supported measures curtailing transgender rights.It may prove easier for Republicans like Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis to talk about transgender issues than about abortion, an issue that has been a mainstay of the conservative movement. The Supreme Court decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion created a backlash among Democrats and independents that has left many Republicans unsure of how - or whether - to address the issue.Polling suggests that the public is less likely to support transgender rights than same-sex marriage and abortion rights. In a poll conducted in 2022, the Public Policy Research Institute, a nonpartisan research group, found that 68 percent of respondents favored allowing same-sex couples to marry, including 49 percent of Republicans.By contrast, a poll by the Pew Research Center found that 58 percent of Americans supported requiring that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth; 85 percent of Republicans held that view."For many religious and political conservatives, the same-sex marriage issue has been largely decided - and for the American public, absolutely," said Kelsy Burke, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. "That's not true when it comes to these transgender issues. Americans are much more divided, and this is an issue that can gain a lot more traction."The focus on perceived threats to impressionable children has a long history in American sexual politics. It has its roots in the "Save Our Children" campaign championed in 1977 by Anita Bryant, the singer known for her orange juice commercials, to repeal a local ordinance in Dade-Miami County that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation, a historic setback for the modern gay rights movements.The initial efforts by the conservative movement to deploy transgender issues did not go well. In 2016, North Carolina legislators voted to bar transgender people from using the bathroom of their preference. It created a backlash so harsh - from corporations, sports teams and even Bruce Springsteen - that lawmakers eventually rescinded the bill.As a result, conservatives went looking for a new approach to the issue. Mr. Schilling's organization, for instance, conducted polling to determine whether curbing transgender rights had resonance with voters - and, if they did, the best way for candidates to talk about it. In 2019, the group's research found that voters were significantly more likely to support a Republican candidate who favored a ban on transgender girls participating in school sports - particularly when framed as a question of whether "to allow men and boys to compete against women and girls" - than a candidate pushing for a ban on transgender people using a bathroom of their choosing.With that evidence in hand, and transgender athletes gaining attention, particularly in right-wing media, conservatives decided to focus on two main fronts: legislation that addressed participation in sports and laws curtailing the access of minors to medical transition treatments.In March 2020, Idaho became the first state to bar transgender girls from participating in girls' and women's sports, with a bill supporters in the Republican-controlled legislature called the "Fairness in Women's Sports Act."A burst of state legislation began the next year after Democrats took control of Congress and the White House, ending four years in which social conservatives successfully pushed the Trump administration to enact restrictions through executive orders.In the spring of 2021, the Republican-controlled legislature in Arkansas overrode a veto by Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, to enact legislation that made it illegal for minors to receive transition medication or surgery.It was the first such ban in the country - and it was quickly embraced by national groups and circulated to lawmakers in other statehouses as a road map for their own legislation. The effort capitalized on an existing disagreement in the medical profession over when to offer medical transition care to minors. Despite that debate, leading medical groups in the United States, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, say the care should be available to minors and oppose legislative bans.Later that spring, Mr. DeSantis, the Florida governor, traveled to a private Christian school in Jacksonville to sign a bill barring transgender girls from playing K-12 sports. With his approval, Florida became the largest state to date to enact such restrictions, and Mr. DeSantis signaled how important this issue was to his political aspirations."In Florida, girls are going to play girls' sports and boys are going to play boys' sports," he said, winning applause from conservatives he would need to defeat Mr. Trump.To some extent, this surge of legislation was spontaneous. Ms. Drennen, of Media Matters, said state lawmakers appeared to be acting out of a "general animus" toward transgender people, as well as a fear of political reprisals. "They are worried about this coming up in a primary," she said.But for several years, conservative Christian legal groups like the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Liberty Counsel have been shifting their resources.In 2018, Kristen Waggoner, then the general counsel of the Alliance Defending Freedom, was the lead counsel in the Supreme Court defending a Colorado baker who, citing religious beliefs, refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple. The court ruled narrowly in favor of the baker.The next year, the Alliance took on a case involving a group of high school girls in Connecticut who challenged the state and five school boards for permitting transgender students to participate in women's sports. Their lawsuit was rejected by a federal appeals court, but in February the court said it would reinstate the challenge and rehear the case.Mathew D. Staver, the founder and chairman of the Liberty Counsel, which was a major force behind a 2008 voter initiative in California that banned same-sex marriage, said the group is now fighting gender policies in the courts. It has challenged laws, often enacted in states controlled by Democrats, that restrict counseling services designed to change a person's gender identity or sexual orientation, often referred to as conversion therapy."Those counseling bans violate first-amendment speech, because they only allow one point of view on the subject of sexuality," he said.Though some on the left are still uncertain about how to best navigate the fraught politics of transgender issues, there's an emerging consensus on the right. The case of what happened to Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a rising star in the Republican Party, is instructive.In March 2021, Ms. Noem declined to sign a bill passed by her state's Republican-controlled legislature that would have banned transgender girls from sports teams from kindergarten through college. Conservative groups accused her of bowing to "socially left-wing factions." Tucker Carlson of Fox News, in a tense interview with Ms. Noem, implied she was bowing to "big business" in refusing to sign the bill."There's a real political effort now that will extract a punishment from you if you betray the social conservatives," said Frank Cannon, a founder of the American Principles Project. He said the episode with Ms. Noem "sent a signal to every other governor in the country."Eleven months later, the governor appeared to have received the message, signing a similar version of the bill in the interest, she said that day, of "fairness."

        NAIROBI, Kenya - Sudan's nightmare scenario is coming to pass.Fighter jets screamed over Khartoum, the capital, on Sunday, firing rockets into a city of millions. Artillery barrages slammed into the military headquarters, reducing it to a tower of flames. Civilian planes were bombed at the city's airport, where terrified passengers cowered on the terminal floors.The country has been walking a tightrope for four years now, clinging desperately to the dream of the 2019 popular revolution, when protesters toppled a brutal dictator and inspired sweet hopes of democracy.But two power-hungry generals still dominate Sudan. And when their relationship disintegrated into violence this weekend, it set off a breathless descent that appeared to be the realization of many people's worst fears.Fighting spread to the four corners of the country, where the army and a paramilitary unit known as the Rapid Support Forces battled for control of airfields and military bases. One of the factions even captured and held Egyptian soldiers, along with seven Egyptian warplanes, threatening to suck a powerful neighbor into the fight and raising the specter of a regional conflagration.The fighting has also spread deep into Darfur, the Spain-size region that for 20 years has been tormented by its own cycle of violence.For a country that had only recently begun to emerge from international isolation, the chaos is a devastating blow. As Sudan inched toward democracy, the United States had lifted its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. International aid was promised, and Russian moves to establish a foothold there raised its geostrategic value.But Sudan's revolution, like many others, has run aground.For Omar Farook, it spells the end of a dream.Like tens of thousands of others, Mr. Farook once risked his life to join the protesters in 2019 whose defiance brought about the ouster of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Sudan's autocratic ruler of three decades.But this weekend, as Mr. Farook and his wife hunkered down inside their house in the Khartoum suburbs listening to the din of bombs and gunfire, their hopes for democracy evaporated."We feel powerless," he said by phone. "Everyone is worried this will go the way of Yemen or Syria. The ghost of civil war is here."More than 83 people have been killed and over 1,126 others injured since April 13, most of them this weekend, the World Health Organization said. The toll includes civilians caught in the crossfire and is expected to rise.The United Nations World Food Program said that three of its employees had been killed in the western Darfur region and that one of its planes had been destroyed at the airport. The group announced an immediate suspension of all programs in Sudan, where one-third of the country's 45 million people are in need of food aid.Sudan was supposed to usher in a momentous new era this month: a return to civilian rule. The army had promised to hand over power last Tuesday, the fourth anniversary of Mr. al-Bashir's ouster. But that transition depended on the two generals who run the country - the army chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan; and his deputy, the paramilitary commander Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan - keeping their simmering rivalries in check.Instead they started fighting, dragging Africa's third-largest country into a chaotic spiral that many fear will end in full-blown civil war.So far, the world's attention has been fixed mostly on Khartoum, where uninterrupted internet service has allowed residents to broadcast snippets of the frightening street battles raging outside their doors.Stunned by the sudden eruption of violence early Saturday, powerful Western and Arab countries on Sunday stepped up their efforts to persuade General al-Burhan and General Hamdan to stop the fighting.Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke to his counterparts in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, uniting in a call for immediate peace talks. The Arab League, of which Sudan is a member, appealed to the warring parties to "stop the bloodshed."In an emergency session of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, a regional bloc that includes Sudan, the presidents of Kenya, South Sudan and Djibouti agreed to make a joint visit to Khartoum, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. No date was set.Even the U.N. Security Council issued a statement, rare since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, condemning the violence and urging both sides to resume talks.Sudan's warring generals did not seem to be listening.As rival troops exchanged gun and rocket fire on the streets of Sudan, General Hamdan and General al-Burhan engaged in ferocious verbal attacks on television and the internet. Both men claimed to be winning the fight and issued belligerent threats that appeared to leave little room for negotiation.In one interview, General Hamdan said General al-Burhan "will die like any dog" if he was not brought to justice. And as the violence spread, the Sudanese Army posted a video on Facebook showing soldiers in the eastern city of Qadarif stepping on a photo of General Hamdan.Another unpredictable factor loomed in a murky episode involving at least 30 detained soldiers from Sudan's northern neighbor and former colonial ruler, Egypt. General Hamdan's forces captured the Egyptians and seven warplanes on Saturday at an air base in Meroe, 125 miles north of Khartoum.Egypt said the soldiers were in Sudan on a training exercise.But a relative of General Hamdan's, Izzeldin Elsafi, said by phone that the detained soldiers were mostly pilots and aircraft mechanics who had come to Sudan to carry out airstrikes on behalf of the Sudanese military. He blamed Egypt for airstrikes that hit General Hamdan's Rapid Support Forces in Port Sudan and Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, on Sunday morning. The planes had taken off from a second Egyptian camp in Sudan, he said.Those claims could not be verified, but the events made clear the volatility of the conflict and its potential to draw in other states. They also highlighted a critical imbalance between the two clashing military forces: Sudan's army has warplanes. The Rapid Support Forces do not.The fighting in Darfur added another combustible element to the conflict. Darfur is home to several rebel groups that could get sucked into the fight, and it has also been a base for Russia's Wagner private military company, which mines gold there and is allied with General Hamdan.In Khartoum on Sunday, satellite images showed black smoke filling the sky over the airport, where two large Ilyushin transport planes were on fire. At least four other planes have been burned since Saturday, according to satellite imagery reviewed by The Times.Many Sudanese said they could scarcely believe what was happening.Although tensions had been rising between General al-Burhan and General Hamdan for many months, foreign officials pushing for the transition to a civilian government had insisted that it was on track - a source of bitter recrimination now among Sudanese who say the foreigners should have defused the tensions within the military.And although Sudan has experienced numerous wars in its 67-year history, disastrous as they were, they mostly unfolded in the country's periphery, hundreds of miles from the capital.The conflicts led to the secession of South Sudan in 2011; charges of genocide in Darfur at the International Criminal Court; and monumental amounts of death, displacement and suffering, mostly affecting marginalized ethnic groups.But they rarely affected Khartoum directly.That changed dramatically this weekend as residents of the capital experienced the kind of trauma that was previously limited to more distant parts of the country. It coincided with the last 10 days of Ramadan, the monthlong period of fasting that is the holiest on the Islamic calendar.Even after the warring factions announced a three-hour cease-fire in Khartoum on Sunday to allow residents safe passage, the gunfire and explosions did not stop, several people said by phone.In Kafouri, a wealthy neighborhood north of the Nile, Reem Sinada watched in horror on Saturday as a line of paramilitary battle wagons carrying more than 50 fighters pulled up outside her front door. Her family fled to her brother's house nearby - but a day later she was cowering again as the windows and doors of her new shelter shuddered from shellfire landing nearby."I am overcome with very sad feelings," Ms. Sinada said by phone. "But, hopefully, we get through this soon."

        WASHINGTON - When Representative Jim Jordan made his appeal to donors at a recent fund-raiser for the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, he pointed to his clash with Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan prosecutor who has criminally charged former President Donald J. Trump, as the kind of pursuit their money was helping support."The district attorney in Manhattan used federal funds to indict the former president for no crime, and then when we start our investigation, they take us to court," Mr. Jordan, the chairman of the powerful Judiciary Committee, told the donors at a private event in Tennessee last week, according to audio of the event obtained by The New York Times. "That's how crazy it's gotten. So we say thank you for the hard-earned money."It was the latest example of how Mr. Jordan, the right-wing Ohio Republican, has propelled his rise in Congress, where he has made a name for himself with bare-knuckled partisan tactics and a penchant for picking fights with his adversaries, then used his higher profile to raise campaign funds and amass power.When a sexual abuse scandal at Ohio State University threatened to derail his political career, Mr. Jordan punched back in characteristic fashion, details of which have not been previously reported, calling a wrestler's aging parents and asking them to persuade their son to back off the charge that Mr. Jordan knew about the abuse and did nothing, according to interviews conducted for this article.When a Republican speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, wasn't conservative enough for his liking, Mr. Jordan, who co-founded the Freedom Caucus, led the band of hard-right lawmakers who pressured him to resign. Mr. Boehner referred to Mr. Jordan as a legislative and political "terrorist.""I didn't try to be a thorn in the side," Mr. Jordan said in an interview. "I just tried to go do what we told the voters we were going to do. It seemed like that wasn't happening as it should have with the previous Republican leaders."When Mr. Trump needed a band of loyal foot soldiers to question and undermine faith in the 2020 election results, Mr. Jordan led the charge in Congress in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021 mob attack on the Capitol.Now Mr. Jordan, 59, is using his perch on the judiciary panel to defend his most important political patron, Mr. Trump, and to attack his adversaries, including the Biden administration, Democrats and Mr. Bragg, who has brought 34 criminal charges against the former president.On Monday, Mr. Jordan will convene his panel in New York to battle Mr. Bragg on his own turf, in a hearing that aims to spotlight crime in the city on his watch. Mr. Jordan has accused Mr. Bragg of advancing "radical pro-crime, anti-victim policies" while pursuing a case against Mr. Trump that he claims constitutes "interference" in the 2024 presidential race. It is the sort of theatrical maneuver for which Mr. Jordan, who almost always eschews a suit jacket and speaks in a rapid, auctioneer-like cadence, has come to be known.Over eight terms in the House, Mr. Jordan, who served for a decade in Ohio's Statehouse before winning election to Congress, has not been the lead sponsor of a single bill that became law, earning him a perennial ranking from the Center for Effective Lawmaking as among the least effective members of Congress. (Mr. Jordan's aides argue he influences bills in committee without putting his name on them.) Mr. Jordan is also the chairman of a powerful new subcommittee created at the insistence of right-wing Republicans to scrutinize what they call the "weaponization" of government against conservatives, which has yet to produce any new bombshell revelations. That is despite weeks of investigation, a budget of nearly $20 million and scores of staff aides working to uncover wrongdoing.But he measures success in other ways. No single member of Congress has done more to push House Republicans to the right, forcing more mainstream and establishment figures in the party to cede ground to the archconservative wing. He has reserved his most ruthless tactics for Democrats, fighting them at every turn as they pursued investigations of Mr. Trump. These days, his hearings include a level of partisanship and hostility that is notable even by today's hyper-polarized standards.At the weaponization subcommittee's last session, Delegate Stacey Plaskett of the Virgin Islands, the top Democrat, rose from her seat and threw a piece of paper back at a Republican who had handed it to her to prove a point.Ms. Plaskett later said Mr. Jordan's approach had created a "melodramatic, grievance-riddled, wannabe-daytime-drama" atmosphere.Those same tactics have earned him hero status among rank-and-file members of the House G.O.P., particularly those on the far right, many of whom speak of Mr. Jordan with reverence."He's probably one of the most universally respected members," said Representative Mike Johnson, the Republican of Louisiana whom Mr. Jordan supported in his run for Congress and who became an architect of the Electoral College objections. "He can appeal to all members of the conference, but particularly the most conservative among us."Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 3 Republican who has shifted to the right in recent years, becoming a Trump loyalist, called Mr. Jordan a mentor."Jim helped me build my confidence," Ms. Stefanik said.Mr. Jordan has used his cachet with the hard right to build his own influence. During Speaker Kevin McCarthy's prolonged battle in January to entice far-right lawmakers to support him, Mr. McCarthy agreed to a number of demands that further empowered Mr. Jordan, including promising to form the weaponization panel and give it heightened powers and the same amount of funding as the select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.Mr. Jordan has a budget of $19 million, a significant increase from the $7.6 million Democrats spent last year on the Judiciary Committee, and is pursuing 237 witnesses, 88 of whom work in the government, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. He expanded his committee staff to more than 60 members from about 20 in recent weeks, including hiring at least two former F.B.I. agents whom Mr. Jordan believes will provide a road map for how to investigate the agency.He has quietly sent out 163 letters and issued 22 subpoenas, many of which have not been announced but were obtained by The Times. Among those receiving the records demands are technology companies, nonprofit groups and university-affiliated researchers.The committee has obtained nearly 115,000 pages of documents.The goal, Mr. Jordan says, is to put so many "facts on the table" that the need to pass legislation to overhaul the Justice Department and the F.B.I. will become overwhelmingly apparent. And if the agencies don't change, Mr. Jordan says, it will be time to consider cutting funding for federal law enforcement agencies.Any Republican-led impeachment would also run through Mr. Jordan's committee. Asked whether Republicans should seek to try President Biden for high crimes, Mr. Jordan demurred, saying, "That's a question for the entire conference."But Mr. Jordan has also acknowledged there is another goal at work, telling a conservative audience last year the investigations would "help frame up the 2024 race" in a way that benefits Mr. Trump.Some on the right who had initially been concerned that Mr. Jordan was not producing any fresh revelations say his confrontation with Mr. Bragg has changed their minds."Jim Jordan got off to a slow, bumpy start, but he is now firing on all cylinders," said Mike Davis, a former top Republican staff member on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the founder of the conservative Article III Project. He praised Mr. Jordan's effort to go after Mr. Bragg as "critical and very effective."Mr. Jordan attributes his competitiveness to his father - Mr. Jordan's hero - who coached the Little League Baseball and wrestling teams and instilled in his son a love of conservative values. Mr. Jordan threw himself into the sport of wrestling with a single-minded focus, posting a high school record of 150-1. He still remembers his lone loss vividly, and he says it continues to eat at him.Competing for the University of Wisconsin, he won two N.C.A.A. wrestling titles, including one over John Smith, arguably America's greatest wrestler. Mr. Jordan says he applies the lessons he learned from wrestling to his current role.He practices for all his public hearings, going over talking points again and again, as he used to drill wrestling moves, so he can deploy them quickly and to maximum effect."I look at it like a wrestling match," Mr. Jordan says. "I'm going to try to get as a ready as I can. You can't just wing it."It is that fighting instinct that Mr. Jordan most values in Mr. Trump. Traveling through his deep-red district recently, he was asked by Republican supporters whether Mr. Trump was still electable or if it was time to move away from Mr. Trump and get behind a different presidential candidate for 2024. Each time, he said to stick by the former president."I'm 100 percent for President Trump," Mr. Jordan told one local businessman at a gathering in his office in Mansfield, Ohio. "I just like the way he fights."An early and exceedingly loyal devotee to the former president, Mr. Jordan has capitalized on Mr. Trump's backing to acquire considerable power. After Mr. Jordan unsuccessfully challenged Mr. McCarthy in 2018 for the position of minority leader, Mr. Trump privately intervened and persuaded Mr. McCarthy to give Mr. Jordan a top committee post.Mr. Jordan was working out at the House gym when he got the call from Mr. McCarthy offering him the ranking Republican spot on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, forming a mutually beneficial partnership that has held to this day.Former Representative Mick Mulvaney, who was a House Freedom Caucus member with Mr. Jordan before becoming Mr. Trump's budget director, said Mr. Jordan's rise is a reflection of how Republicans have shifted to the right."The party is now more interested in the things that Jim has been interested in from the very beginning," Mr. Mulvaney said. "The party has sort of come to him."Mr. Jordan credits the former president."Because of President Trump, we are now a populist party, rooted in conservative principles, which is frankly where we always should have been," he said.Mr. Jordan likes to refer to himself as "just a country boy," and unlike many members of Congress, his financial disclosure forms show he is not particularly wealthy. His income comes mostly from his $174,000 congressional salary, and he and his wife, Polly, live in a house built in 1837 on eight acres where Mr. Jordan does the mowing and the yard work.But his close ties with Mr. Trump propelled Mr. Jordan to superstar status among conservative media outlets, including Fox News, and his political operation has reaped the financial benefits, recording a 20-fold increase in fund-raising. In 2016, Mr. Jordan's campaign brought in about $732,000; during the last election cycle, it took in $14 million.Still, the abuse scandal that came to light in 2018, concerning Mr. Jordan's time as a young assistant coach at Ohio State University, threatened to sink his career.Five former wrestlers, including Mark Coleman, a former U.F.C. champion, said Mr. Jordan was aware of the abuse by a team doctor, Richard Strauss, who was accused of abusing 177 male student athletes over two decades, but did nothing to stop it, an allegation Mr. Jordan has consistently denied.A conservative public relations firm aligned with Mr. Jordan pushed back, circulating statements of support defending Mr. Jordan and claiming that the accusers were "seeing dollar signs."Mr. Coleman soon walked back his statement and released a second one saying he had merely been referring to how widely known Dr. Strauss's predatory behavior had been around the university. He clarified that he had no knowledge of anyone reporting a specific abuse claim to Mr. Jordan.In an interview, Mr. Coleman said he stood by both statements but had made the second only after Mr. Jordan spoke by phone with Mr. Coleman's aging parents in an effort to get him to change his story. A lawyer who worked on Mr. Jordan's behalf during the scandal did not dispute the account but said the conversation happened after the parents approached the congressman at an event and expressed a desire to clarify what their son had said.Mr. Coleman said allies of Mr. Jordan also reached out to him directly, including a lawyer who helped prepare his second statement.In the interview, Mr. Coleman said Dr. Strauss routinely took 45-minute showers to ogle the athletes, including Mr. Jordan."Jim got stared at; I got stared at. Unless he has Alzheimer's, Jim Jordan knew," Mr. Coleman said. "But I have no knowledge of anyone being abused reporting it to Jim Jordan, and I have no problem with Jim Jordan. He was a fantastic coach. He's a good man - a good, churchgoing family man."At the height of the scandal, Mr. Trump defended Mr. Jordan."I don't believe them at all; I believe him," Mr. Trump said then. "Jim Jordan is one of the most outstanding people I've met since I've been in Washington."As he has risen in the G.O.P., Mr. Jordan has repeatedly proved himself to Mr. Trump.During the darkest weekend for Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign, after he was caught on tape boasting about grabbing women, Mr. Jordan and his wife, Polly, publicly doubled down on the Trump candidacy. As other Republicans rushed to distance themselves, Mrs. Jordan flew to North Carolina to join a Women For Trump bus tour.Mr. Jordan was also there for Mr. Trump after he lost the 2020 election and began searching for ways to cling to power. The Ohio Republican helped devise a communications strategy to undermine public confidence in the election results and became a key planner of the congressional objections to Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory.On Jan. 5, 2021 a day before rioters stormed the Capitol, Mr. Jordan forwarded to his friend Mark Meadows, then the White House chief of staff, a text message he had received from a former Pentagon inspector general outlining a legal strategy to overturn Mr. Trump's election loss.White House calls logs show Mr. Trump reached out on the morning of Jan. 6 to Mr. Jordan, who had been organizing objections to Mr. Biden's election on the House floor, and spoke with him for 10 minutes.Later that day, with the Capitol under siege, Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, angrily singled out Mr. Jordan for blame amid the mayhem.In an interview, Mr. Jordan defended his actions."The terrible things that happened that day didn't change the fact that several states - the best example being Pennsylvania - changed their laws in an unconstitutional fashion," Mr. Jordan says. "I actually felt like we weren't doing our duty if we didn't object."The House Jan. 6 committee issued a subpoena to Mr. Jordan, which he resisted, creating a precedent that has complicated his efforts to compel Mr. Bragg and other would-be witnesses to cooperate with his panel now. Five days after the attack on the Capitol, Mr. Jordan and his family attended a private ceremony at the White House. The National Guard was still posted at the Capitol, a seven-foot fence had been installed around its perimeter, and lawmakers were working on a second impeachment of Mr. Trump.But as Mr. Jordan's mother and mother-in-law posed for a photo with Ivanka Trump, Mr. Jordan made an emotional speech extolling Mr. Trump."No president in my lifetime has done more of what they said they would do," he said.Then Mr. Trump put the Presidential Medal of Freedom - the highest civilian honor an American can receive - around Mr. Jordan's neck.

            <h2>How Fast Is Eliud Kipchoge? You'll Fall Down When You Find Out.</h2>

        BOSTON - Some numbers are difficult to comprehend. The human body, for example, is made up of about 40 trillion cells. Earth is about 93 million miles from the sun (give or take a couple of million).And Eliud Kipchoge has run a marathon in 2 hours 1 minute 9 seconds.Anyone remotely familiar with the marathon - and all 26.2188 miles of its muscle-searing masochism - can appreciate that Kipchoge's world record for the distance, which he set last September when he won the Berlin Marathon for the fourth time, is fast. But how fast, exactly?Well, you could head to your neighborhood track and try to run a 400-meter loop, which is roughly equivalent to a quarter-mile, in about 69 seconds - and run an additional 104 laps at that pace. Or you could attempt to run a 4:37 mile, then do another 25 of them.But perhaps the most inventive way to contextualize Kipchoge's marathon tempo comes via an enormous treadmill, equipped with flexible matting and carbon fiber rods, which was originally designed for use on television game shows and for film stunt work.It is called the Tumbleator, and Kipchoge, who will tackle the Boston Marathon for the first time on Monday, described himself as a fan."I think it's a great motivation for the human family," he said in an interview last month from Kenya, where he was training. "It's good for people to run on it and feel it and get the experience. It's a positive thing."The Tumbleator, which is about 6 feet wide and 20 feet long, made its debut at a running exposition ahead of the 2017 London Marathon where anyone could take on the challenge of running 400 meters at a "world-class marathon pace," according to Canning Conveyor, the British company that built the contraption.That worked out to about 13 miles per hour, a sprint for most mortals. The fallout was literal and predictable: The Tumbleator welcomed weekend warriors onto its springy surface before spitting most of them out the back as it ramped up its speed, sending them into the safe embrace of padded gymnastics mats.The giant treadmill was not originally associated with one particular athlete, but it did not take long for it to be tied to Kipchoge, 38, for the simple reason that he was faster than everyone else. He first shattered the world record at the 2018 Berlin Marathon when he finished in 2:01:39.A few months later, the Tumbleator was unveiled for the first time at the Chicago Marathon, where a fresh batch of runners got a firsthand feel for Kipchoge's pace - for 200 meters, which was long enough.What does that pace feel like to the man himself, out on the open road?"I think I can say that I enjoy that pace," Kipchoge said. "My training is enough to go at that pace."The Tumbleator, which spends most of its time in Europe, will make its next public appearance at the London Marathon, which is scheduled for April 23.The power of the marathon, and what separates it from so many other sporting events, is its communal feel, said Danny Coyle, the head of digital and social media for the Abbott World Marathon Majors. Most humans will never play in a World Series, drive a Formula 1 car or take Centre Court at Wimbledon."But when you do a marathon, you run the same 26.2 miles as the best athletes on the planet," Coyle said. Indeed, on Monday, Kipchoge will warm up the Boston Marathon route for some 30,000 runners behind him.And the Tumbleator, in its own cartoonish way, has offered an additional avenue for amateur athletes to bridge the gap between themselves and elites like Kipchoge, albeit for 20 or 30 seconds tops."And it just looks fun, right?" Coyle said. "Who doesn't love a giant treadmill?"The siren song of the Tumbleator was irresistible to Mo Farah before his appearance at the 2019 London Marathon. A four-time Olympic champion, Farah tumbled - twice."Even some of the best in the world can struggle on the Tumbleator," Coyle said.A few days later, Kipchoge went on to win the race. Farah finished in fifth place.It should be noted that Kipchoge was not born a champion. As a child in Kapsisiywa, a small village in western Kenya, he ran back and forth to school. As a teenager, he helped support his family by collecting milk from neighbors and selling it at a market. A more formal introduction to running came at age 16, when Patrick Sang, an Olympic silver medalist in the steeplechase, returned to Kenya to organize sports events. Kipchoge soon became a protégé. Sang, 58, has remained his coach.At 18, Kipchoge won a world championship in the 5,000 meters. He followed that with a pair of Olympic medals in the event, winning bronze in 2004 and silver in 2008. He transitioned to the marathon in 2013.He has since owned the event, winning 10 world marathon majors and 15 of the 17 marathons he has entered. At the Tokyo Games held in 2021, he successfully defended his 2016 Olympic title in dominant fashion. And last year, he broke his own world record by shaving 30 seconds from it. He has officially clocked four of the six fastest marathons ever.In October 2022, when Kipchoge got a chance to see the Tumbleator in action before the London Marathon, he wished participants luck in "trying out my new world-record pace." (He also apologized to race officials for breaking the world record, since some of their signage was then outdated.) More spills ensued."It's good!" said Kipchoge, who often speaks as if every sentence should be punctuated by an exclamation point. "For someone to fall, that's a challenge! That means they need to work more."In training, Kipchoge often runs up to 140 miles a week. While that might sound like another outlandish figure, he is not entirely unrelatable: Most of his runs, he said, are on the slow side. Then again, slow for him is a shade quicker than seven minutes per mile."We really try to run in an easy way," he said. "It's good for our minds to think more and it's good for our muscles to rejuvenate and be ready for the next day."And the man who has become synonymous with the Tumbleator seldom runs on a treadmill."I prefer to be outside," he said.

        BOSTON - Less than 24 hours before 30,000 runners would board buses to the starting line of the Boston Marathon, a different type of excited energy pulsed through Boston Common.Will, Sammy, Mandy, Cather, Lucy, Frank, Flynn and Lou were there. So were Kona, River, Miko, Clementine, Lily, Maple, Cedar and Chester.They were not wearing high-tech sneakers or racing bibs. They had four legs each, were panting wildly and drooling just a bit.They were some of the 250 or so dogs that descended on a public park in downtown Boston to honor two golden retrievers that became inextricably linked to the Boston Marathon. Spencer, a therapy dog who became the Boston Marathon's official race dog, died Feb. 17 at age 13 from an inoperable cancer.Spencer gained fame as an enthusiastic spectator at Mile 3 of the marathon course who dutifully held a Boston Strong flag as runners stopped for photos. He became so popular that runners sometimes lined up for the chance, adding seconds, if not minutes, to their times. But no matter: It was Spencer.A week after Spencer died, Penny, one of his litter mates' offspring, also died, from hemangiosarcoma, a type of cancer."Did he stay for her or did she stay for him?" Rich Powers, their owner, wondered. "They were so bonded."Powers and his wife, Dorrey, have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support in the weeks since their dogs died. Losing Spencer was difficult enough, Rich Powers said. "Losing Penny threw us to a level of sadness we weren't prepared for."The response was immediate and global. They have received cards; thousands of dollars in donations to the Morris Animal Foundation, a nonprofit based in Colorado; visits from local dogs; and a surprise in the form of Sunday's event, which was organized by MA Golden Meetups as a tribute to Spencer and Penny.On Sunday, what was once expected to be 20 dogs turned into a full field of fur."The only thing better than one golden is a whole bunch of goldens," Deb Litterer of Rhode Island said.She added: "What I'm surprised about is how good they are all being today. They are all being therapy dogs."The dogs, some of whom were official therapy dogs like Spencer, were on their best behavior, and obliged the many photo requests. There were endless refrains of "oh my God" followed by squeals.There was a dog wearing a Boston Bruins hat, a dog wearing what looked like running shoes, dogs wearing rainbow harnesses, dogs wearing Golden Strong bandannas, dogs wearing rubber ducky raincoats despite the temperate weather and a dog wearing a Santa hat.The scale of the group came into focus when volunteers started coordinating a group photo. Some small dogs in the area, including a Shih Tzu named Miko, looked deeply confused.At one point, a photographer shouted, "If all the dogs could look at me," to laughs from the crowd. Some dogs seemed to pay attention.Rich and Dorrey Powers sat at the center. Rich Powers held the Boston Strong flag that Spencer once carried and a photograph of the two dogs. Rich Powers was wearing a navy blue raincoat, the same one he put on Spencer when they cheered in the cold rain at the 2018 Boston Marathon. They were both beaming, even if their eyes appeared a bit misty."I'm overwhelmed," he said. "I think I can safely say that Spencer and Penny have impacted millions now."Stephanie Ormond of Fresno, Calif., came to the event without a dog. Her nails were painted with logos to match the course. A broken heart for Heartbreak Hill at Mile 20 of the course, a Citgo sign, the Boston Marathon unicorn and, on her thumb, the unmistakable image of Spencer holding his flag. She said that she would be running the race the next day and that "Spencer was my favorite part of the marathon."It was a sentiment shared by many who mingled in the park wearing Boston Marathon jackets from years past.On Monday, about 30,000 runners will not see Spencer or Penny on the course near Ashland, Mass. But Rich Powers will be there.The Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the marathon, offered to take him to the start or the finish as a special guest, he said, but he declined.He wanted to be where he always was. At Mile 3, on the runners' right, with Spencer's flag, wearing the blue rain jacket that once protected his dog from the elements.

        The 127th Boston Marathon is the mother of all marathons - the oldest. About 30,000 runners will chase the elite professionals toward the finish line on Boylston Street on Monday.Here's how to watch the race on TV and in person.The race will be broadcast on ESPN from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Eastern and will be broadcast locally on WCVB (Channel 5) in Boston from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern.The race will be available to livestream on Very Local Boston.9:02 a.m. Men's wheelchair9:05 a.m. Women's wheelchair9:30 a.m. Handcycle and duos participants9:37 a.m. Professional men9:45 a.m. Professional women9:50 a.m. Para athletics division10 a.m. Wave 110:25 a.m. Wave 210:50 a.m. Wave 311:15 a.m. Wave 4Spectating is a sport too. So what kind of spectator do you want to be?The early-in-the-race spectator: The Framingham train station, at the 6.6-mile mark, is a good spot to go if you want an early glimpse of the athletes. You can then take an inbound commuter train to catch them again in Boston.The scene chaser: If you want a scenic spot for cheering, head to the Natick town center at Mile 10. And if you want a really scene-y spot, head to Wellesley College at Mile 13 to witness the Wellesley "scream tunnel." It's even louder than you think.The cheerleader: If you want to help the runners along, head for the Newton Hills between the 17.5-mile mark and Mile 21.The "almost there" screamer: Please, please do not scream, "You're almost there," until runners are, in fact, almost there. What qualifies as almost there? From our vantage point: when you can see the finish line. If you want to catch runners in those final 600 yards, find a spot along Boylston Street.If you are hoping to catch a runner in a few spots, try to get a sense of that runner's pace so you can map out your commute.The Boston Athletic Association has an app that will allow users to track participants throughout the day. Enter bib numbers or names to track runners and receive alerts when they pass certain points on the course.

            <h2>How Fast Is Eliud Kipchoge? You'll Fall Down When You Find Out.</h2>

        BOSTON - Some numbers are difficult to comprehend. The human body, for example, is made up of about 40 trillion cells. Earth is about 93 million miles from the sun (give or take a couple of million).And Eliud Kipchoge has run a marathon in 2 hours 1 minute 9 seconds.Anyone remotely familiar with the marathon - and all 26.2188 miles of its muscle-searing masochism - can appreciate that Kipchoge's world record for the distance, which he set last September when he won the Berlin Marathon for the fourth time, is fast. But how fast, exactly?Well, you could head to your neighborhood track and try to run a 400-meter loop, which is roughly equivalent to a quarter-mile, in about 69 seconds - and run an additional 104 laps at that pace. Or you could attempt to run a 4:37 mile, then do another 25 of them.But perhaps the most inventive way to contextualize Kipchoge's marathon tempo comes via an enormous treadmill, equipped with flexible matting and carbon fiber rods, which was originally designed for use on television game shows and for film stunt work.It is called the Tumbleator, and Kipchoge, who will tackle the Boston Marathon for the first time on Monday, described himself as a fan."I think it's a great motivation for the human family," he said in an interview last month from Kenya, where he was training. "It's good for people to run on it and feel it and get the experience. It's a positive thing."The Tumbleator, which is about 6 feet wide and 20 feet long, made its debut at a running exposition ahead of the 2017 London Marathon where anyone could take on the challenge of running 400 meters at a "world-class marathon pace," according to Canning Conveyor, the British company that built the contraption.That worked out to about 13 miles per hour, a sprint for most mortals. The fallout was literal and predictable: The Tumbleator welcomed weekend warriors onto its springy surface before spitting most of them out the back as it ramped up its speed, sending them into the safe embrace of padded gymnastics mats.The giant treadmill was not originally associated with one particular athlete, but it did not take long for it to be tied to Kipchoge, 38, for the simple reason that he was faster than everyone else. He first shattered the world record at the 2018 Berlin Marathon when he finished in 2:01:39.A few months later, the Tumbleator was unveiled for the first time at the Chicago Marathon, where a fresh batch of runners got a firsthand feel for Kipchoge's pace - for 200 meters, which was long enough.What does that pace feel like to the man himself, out on the open road?"I think I can say that I enjoy that pace," Kipchoge said. "My training is enough to go at that pace."The Tumbleator, which spends most of its time in Europe, will make its next public appearance at the London Marathon, which is scheduled for April 23.The power of the marathon, and what separates it from so many other sporting events, is its communal feel, said Danny Coyle, the head of digital and social media for the Abbott World Marathon Majors. Most humans will never play in a World Series, drive a Formula 1 car or take Centre Court at Wimbledon."But when you do a marathon, you run the same 26.2 miles as the best athletes on the planet," Coyle said. Indeed, on Monday, Kipchoge will warm up the Boston Marathon route for some 30,000 runners behind him.And the Tumbleator, in its own cartoonish way, has offered an additional avenue for amateur athletes to bridge the gap between themselves and elites like Kipchoge, albeit for 20 or 30 seconds tops."And it just looks fun, right?" Coyle said. "Who doesn't love a giant treadmill?"The siren song of the Tumbleator was irresistible to Mo Farah before his appearance at the 2019 London Marathon. A four-time Olympic champion, Farah tumbled - twice."Even some of the best in the world can struggle on the Tumbleator," Coyle said.A few days later, Kipchoge went on to win the race. Farah finished in fifth place.It should be noted that Kipchoge was not born a champion. As a child in Kapsisiywa, a small village in western Kenya, he ran back and forth to school. As a teenager, he helped support his family by collecting milk from neighbors and selling it at a market. A more formal introduction to running came at age 16, when Patrick Sang, an Olympic silver medalist in the steeplechase, returned to Kenya to organize sports events. Kipchoge soon became a protégé. Sang, 58, has remained his coach.At 18, Kipchoge won a world championship in the 5,000 meters. He followed that with a pair of Olympic medals in the event, winning bronze in 2004 and silver in 2008. He transitioned to the marathon in 2013.He has since owned the event, winning 10 world marathon majors and 15 of the 17 marathons he has entered. At the Tokyo Games held in 2021, he successfully defended his 2016 Olympic title in dominant fashion. And last year, he broke his own world record by shaving 30 seconds from it. He has officially clocked four of the six fastest marathons ever.In October 2022, when Kipchoge got a chance to see the Tumbleator in action before the London Marathon, he wished participants luck in "trying out my new world-record pace." (He also apologized to race officials for breaking the world record, since some of their signage was then outdated.) More spills ensued."It's good!" said Kipchoge, who often speaks as if every sentence should be punctuated by an exclamation point. "For someone to fall, that's a challenge! That means they need to work more."In training, Kipchoge often runs up to 140 miles a week. While that might sound like another outlandish figure, he is not entirely unrelatable: Most of his runs, he said, are on the slow side. Then again, slow for him is a shade quicker than seven minutes per mile."We really try to run in an easy way," he said. "It's good for our minds to think more and it's good for our muscles to rejuvenate and be ready for the next day."And the man who has become synonymous with the Tumbleator seldom runs on a treadmill."I prefer to be outside," he said.

        WILMINGTON, Del. - A judge in Delaware Superior Court is expected to swear in the jury this week in a defamation trial that has little precedent in American law. Fox News, one of the most powerful and profitable media companies, will defend itself against extensive evidence suggesting it told its audience a story of conspiracy and fraud in the 2020 election it knew wasn't true.The jury will be asked to weigh lofty questions about the limits of the First Amendment and to consider imposing a huge financial penalty against Fox. Some of the most influential names in conservative media - Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson - are expected to be called to testify. But there is another fundamental question the case raises: Will there be a price to pay for profiting from the spread of misinformation?Few people have been held legally accountable for their roles in trying to delegitimize President Biden's victory. Sidney Powell, a lawyer who was one of the biggest purveyors of conspiracy theories about Dominion Voting Systems, the company suing Fox for $1.6 billion, avoided disbarment in Texas after a judge dismissed a complaint against her in February.Jenna Ellis, an attorney who worked with Ms. Powell and the Trump campaign, received a reprimand last month instead of losing her license with the Colorado bar. Donald J. Trump, whose false insistence that he was cheated of victory incited a violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, is running for president a third time and remains the clear front-runner for the Republican nomination.Judge Eric M. Davis, who is overseeing the case, said in a statement on Sunday that the trial would be delayed by a day, until Tuesday. He did not cite a reason but said he would make an announcement Monday at 9 a.m.Political misinformation has become so pervasive partly because there is little the government can do to stop it."Lying to American voters is not actually actionable," said Andrew Weissmann, the former general counsel of the F.B.I. who was a senior member of the special counsel team under Robert S. Mueller that looked into Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.It's a quirk of American law that most lies - even ones that destabilize the nation, told by people with enormous power and reach - can't be prosecuted. Charges can be brought only in limited circumstances, such as if a business executive lies to shareholders or an individual lies to the F.B.I. Politicians can be charged if they lie about a campaign contribution, which is the essence of the criminal case against Mr. Trump by the Manhattan district attorney's office.In the Fox News case, the trial is going forward because the law allows companies like Dominion, and people, to seek damages if they can prove their reputations were harmed by lies.The legal bar that a company like Dominion must meet to prove defamation is known as actual malice. And it is extremely difficult to prove because of the Supreme Court's 1964 decision in New York Times Company v. Sullivan, which held that public officials can claim defamation only if they can prove that the defendants either knew that they were making a false statement or were reckless in deciding to publish the defamatory statement."There are all sorts of times you can lie with impunity, but here there's an actual victim," Mr. Weissmann added. "It's only because of the serendipity that they actually attacked a company."Usually, there is great deference among media lawyers and First Amendment scholars toward the defendants in a libel case. They argue that the law is supposed to provide the media with breathing room to make mistakes, even serious ones, as long as they are not intentional.But many legal scholars have said that they believed there was ample evidence to support Dominion's case, in which they argue they were intentionally harmed by the lies broadcast by Fox, and that they would not only be surprised but disappointed if a jury didn't find Fox liable for defamation."If this case goes the wrong way," said John Culhane, professor of law at Delaware Law School at Widener University, "it's clear from my perspective that would be a terrible mistake because this is about as strong as a case you're going to get on defamation." Mr. Culhane added that a Fox victory would only make it harder to rein in the kind of misinformation that's rampant in pro-Trump media."I think it would embolden them even further," he said.This case has proved to be extraordinary on many levels, not only for its potential to deliver the kind of judgment that has so far eluded prosecutors like Mr. Weissmann, who have spent years pursuing Mr. Trump and his supporters who they believe bent the American democratic system to a breaking point."Even if this didn't involve Donald Trump and Fox and the insurrection, this is a unique libel trial, full stop," said David Logan, a professor of law at Roger Williams School of Law and an expert on defamation. "There's never been one like this before."It is extremely rare for defamation cases to reach a jury. Mr. Logan said his research shows a steady decline over the years, with an average of 27 per year in the 1980s but only three in 2017.Some experts like Mr. Logan believe the case's significance could grow beyond its relevance to the current disinformation-plagued political climate. They see an opportunity for the Supreme Court to eventually take the case as a vehicle to revisit libel law and the "actual malice" standard. The justices have not done that since a 1989 case involving a losing candidate for municipal office in Ohio who successfully sued a newspaper after it published a false story about him a week before the election. The court said that a public figure cannot recover damages unless there was "clear and convincing proof" of actual malice.The actual malice standard has been vital for individual journalists and media outlets who make mistakes - as long as they are honest mistakes. But some scholars like Mr. Logan - as well as two conservative Supreme Court justices, Neil M. Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas - have argued that "actual malice" should be reconsidered as too high a standard. Justice Thomas specifically cited as a reason "the proliferation of falsehoods.""The nature of this privilege goes to the heart of our democracy, particularly in this case," said Mr. Logan, whose paper arguing that the courts have made it too difficult for victims of libel to win relief was cited in a dissent by Justice Gorsuch in 2021.Fox lawyers are already preparing for an appeal - a sign they are under no illusion that beating Dominion's case will be easy. At several recent hearings in front of Judge Davis, Fox has been represented by Erin Murphy, an appellate lawyer with experience arguing cases before the Supreme Court.Dominion also apparently considers the possibility of an appeal quite realistic. It had an appellate attorney of its own, Rodney A. Smolla, arguing on its behalf when questions of Fox's First Amendment defense arose last month - the kind of constitutional questions that federal appellate courts will entertain.The belief that the Supreme Court could eventually hear the Fox-Dominion case is shared by the general counsel of Fox Corporation, Viet Dinh. Mr. Dinh, who is likely to be called as a witness by Dominion during the trial, has told colleagues privately that he believes Fox's odds at the Supreme Court would be good - certainly better than in front of a Delaware jury, according to people who know his thinking. The evidence against Fox includes copious amounts of text messages and emails showing that producers, hosts and executives belittled the claims being made on air of hacked voting machines and conspiracy, details that Dominion has said prove the network defamed it.But Fox lawyers and its public relations department have been making the case that its broadcasts were protected under the First Amendment because they encompassed the kind of coverage and commentary that media outlets have a right to do on official events of intense public interest."A free-flowing, robust American discourse depends on First Amendment protections for the press' news gathering and reporting," a network spokeswoman said in a written statement. The statement added that Fox viewers expected the kind of commentary that aired on the network after the election "just as they expect hyperbole, speculation and opinion from a newspaper's op-ed section."Judge Davis has overruled Fox on some of its First Amendment claims, limiting its ability to argue certain points at trial, such as its contention that it did not endorse any false statements by the president and his allies but merely repeated them as it would any newsworthy statement.A spokeswoman for Dominion expressed confidence, saying: "In the coming weeks, we will prove Fox spread lies causing enormous damage to Dominion. We look forward to trial."Inside Fox, from the corporate offices in Los Angeles to the news channel's Manhattan headquarters, there is little optimism about the case. Several current and former employees said privately that few people at the company would be surprised to see a jury return a judgment against Fox. Judge Davis has expressed considerable skepticism toward Fox in the courtroom. He issued a sanction against Fox last week when Dominion disclosed that the company had not revealed details about Mr. Murdoch's involvement in Fox News's affairs, ruling that Dominion had a right to conduct further depositions at Fox's expense. In a letter to the judge on Friday, Fox said, "We understand the court's concerns, apologize, and are committed to clear and full communication with the court moving forward."But the judge does not have the final say. Twelve men and women from Delaware will ultimately decide the case. And defamation suits so rarely prevail, it's also reasonable to consider the possibility that Fox does win - and what a 2024 election looks like with an emboldened pro-Trump media.

Mr. Dinh, who is likely to be called as a witness by Dominion during the trial, has told colleagues privately that he believes Fox's odds at the Supreme Court would be good - certainly better than in front of a Delaware jury, according to people who know his thinking. The evidence against Fox includes copious amounts of text messages and emails showing that producers, hosts and executives belittled the claims being made on air of hacked voting machines and conspiracy, details that Dominion has said prove the network defamed it.But Fox lawyers and its public relations department have been making the case that its broadcasts were protected under the First Amendment because they encompassed the kind of coverage and commentary that media outlets have a right to do on official events of intense public interest."A free-flowing, robust American discourse depends on First Amendment protections for the press' news gathering and reporting," a network spokeswoman said in a written statement. The statement added that Fox viewers expected the kind of commentary that aired on the network after the election "just as they expect hyperbole, speculation and opinion from a newspaper's op-ed section."Judge Davis has overruled Fox on some of its First Amendment claims, limiting its ability to argue certain points at trial, such as its contention that it did not endorse any false statements by the president and his allies but merely repeated them as it would any newsworthy statement.A spokeswoman for Dominion expressed confidence, saying: "In the coming weeks, we will prove Fox spread lies causing enormous damage to Dominion. We look forward to trial."Inside Fox, from the corporate offices in Los Angeles to the news channel's Manhattan headquarters, there is little optimism about the case. Several current and former employees said privately that few people at the company would be surprised to see a jury return a judgment against Fox. Judge Davis has expressed considerable skepticism toward Fox in the courtroom. He issued a sanction against Fox last week when Dominion disclosed that the company had not revealed details about Mr. Murdoch's involvement in Fox News's affairs, ruling that Dominion had a right to conduct further depositions at Fox's expense. In a letter to the judge on Friday, Fox said, "We understand the court's concerns, apologize, and are committed to clear and full communication with the court moving forward."But the judge does not have the final say. Twelve men and women from Delaware will ultimately decide the case. And defamation suits so rarely prevail, it's also reasonable to consider the possibility that Fox does win - and what a 2024 election looks like with an emboldened pro-Trump media.

        KYIV, Ukraine - The European Union has criticized bans by Poland and Hungary on imports of Ukrainian grain and other foods over the weekend, saying the unilateral moves were "unacceptable."The bloc, of which Poland and Hungary are member states, lifted tariffs on Ukrainian grain last year to help transport it to the rest of the world amid Russia's invasion, but the exports have led to a glut of produce in Europe. As a result, farmers in Poland, Hungary and other nations have seen their incomes plummet.Hungary's agriculture minister said on Saturday that "in the absence of meaningful E.U. measures," his country would follow Poland in restricting Ukrainian grain imports until the end of June, according to Hungarian news reports. The announcement came after Warsaw reached a deal with Kyiv on Friday to strictly limit and, for a time, halt Ukrainian grain deliveries to Poland.That deal was expected to affect Ukrainian grain, wheat, corn and some other produce, but on Saturday, Poland expanded it to include dozens of other types of food. Poland's economic development and technology minister, Waldemar Buda, said in a tweet on Sunday that the measure would also prevent the transit of Ukrainian products through Poland.A spokesperson for the European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, said in an email on Sunday that such a trade policy was a matter of "E.U. exclusive competence," meaning that only the bloc could adopt legally binding decisions. "Unilateral actions are not acceptable," the statement said.The announcements from Hungary and Poland come as Russia has expressed doubts about extending the Black Sea grain deal, which the United Nations and Turkey brokered last year and was scheduled to expire in the next few weeks. The agreement, which allows wartime grain shipments to leave Ukraine's Black Sea ports, has been crucial for alleviating global food shortages and limiting price increases.The Black Sea deal was renewed in March, but the United Nations did not say how long it would last. Russia, which at the time said the agreement was valid through May 18, has expressed dissatisfaction with the deal for months because of Western sanctions that have hindered its own food and fertilizer exports. The agreement would become even more vital if Ukraine could not ship grain and foodstuffs over land routes in Eastern Europe, through Poland and Hungary.There had been signs in recent weeks that Ukraine's food exports were becoming a sore point in relations with Poland, one of its staunchest allies amid the war. Last month, the prime ministers of Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia called on the European Union to take steps to curb the influx of Ukrainian produce that had been pushing down prices and said Europe should consider reinstating tariffs.Facing a general election later this year and worried that discontent among farmers could erode support among its predominantly conservative, rural base, Poland's governing Law and Justice party has made solving the grain issue a priority.Poland's new agriculture minister, Robert Telus, whose predecessor resigned this month, during a state visit to Poland by President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, said at a party convention on Saturday that halting grain deliveries would act as a "shield" for Polish farmers.Ukraine's agriculture minister, Mykola Solskyi, said on Saturday that Kyiv understood that its agricultural exports represented "tough competition" for other countries, but added, "The Ukrainian farmer is in the most difficult situation." Mr. Solskyi was expected to travel to Poland on Monday to continue talks on the issue.As Ukraine faced pushback on its grain exports, on the battlefield over the weekend, the Russian assault remained focused on the eastern front near the towns of Lyman and Bakhmut, according to a statement from the Ukrainian Army's general staff on Sunday."The battles for the city of Bakhmut do not stop," the statement said.The fight for the devastated city has been grinding on for months, claiming many lives on both sides, though the toll so far has most likely been much higher for Russia's forces.Early on Saturday, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed that the Wagner mercenary force had taken control of two areas on the northern and southern outskirts of Bakhmut. The remaining Ukrainian forces in the city, the Russian ministry said on the Telegram messaging app, were "retreating and deliberately destroying the city's infrastructure and residential buildings to slow down the advance of Russian troops."Those claims could not be immediately verified.As of late last week, Ukrainian soldiers were defending a shrinking half-circle of destroyed buildings in a western neighborhood of Bakhmut, about 20 blocks wide in the 16-square-mile city.Ukraine's army is determined to hold out, even as allies have quietly questioned the rationale for sustaining significant casualties in a city that has been reduced to rubble. For both sides, Bakhmut has taken on a symbolic significance, military analysts say.Attention is also increasingly turning to the war's southern front, where Russian forces hold a belt of land along the Sea of Azov in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Donetsk regions. In recent weeks, Russia has been building up its troop numbers, planting land mines and erecting defensive barriers along a front line east of the Dnipro River in the expectation that Ukraine could launch a counteroffensive there.The Russian authorities have started to evacuate children from the city of Enerhodar in the Zaporizhzhia region to Crimea, according to a statement posted by Ukraine's state nuclear company, Energoatom, on Telegram Sunday. The claim, which could not be independently confirmed, echoed other recent statements by Ukrainian officials about evacuations from other parts of the Russian-occupied south. Enerhodar lies next to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which is in Russian hands.Russian officials have deported thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia or to Russian-held territory under the guise of evacuating them from the threat of fighting, Ukrainian officials say. The International Criminal Court last month issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for war crimes, saying he bore criminal responsibility for the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children.Russia, meanwhile, has continued shelling towns and cities behind the front line. On Friday, a Russian missile strike on a residential area in the city of Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine killed 11 people and injured 22 others. The Ukrainian authorities said on Sunday that four more people remained under the rubble.Earlier on Sunday, two teenagers were killed when a missile hit a building in the community of Snihurivka, in the Mykolaiv region, the head of the military administration there, Vitaliy Kim, said on Telegram.Two others were killed and two more were injured in a strike on Sunday on the part of the Kherson region under Ukraine's control, Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of the region's military administration, said on Telegram. Russian attacks over the past few days have been met with particular outrage in Ukraine, given that it is Holy Week for Orthodox Christians. In addition, 130 Ukrainian prisoners of war were returned to the country in an Easter swap with Russia, Andriy Yermak, the head of Mr. Zelensky's office, said on Telegram. He did not say how many prisoners had been returned to Russia.Mr. Zelensky referred to Easter in an impassioned speech released overnight, in which he held out hope that the country could reclaim all of the territory it lost."The sun will shine in the south, the sun will shine in the east and the sun will shine in Crimea," he said.

        Hundreds of Orthodox Christians lined up outside a cathedral in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, after a service on Sunday as they waited for a priest to bless them with a spray of water as part of an Easter tradition.They carried baskets packed with candles, delicately dyed eggs, paskha cake, chunks of cured pork fat known as salo, and sweet Ukrainian wine called Kagor. As the priest came down the line, some flinched or burst into giggles as the water caught their faces.Alisa Kupchyn, 18, who stood in the half circle of people outside the church, the Holy Dormition Cathedral, said she wasn't normally a churchgoer but she respected holy days."I just moved to Kyiv and wanted to visit the famous church," she said, having arrived from the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine for medical studies.It is the second year that the Orthodox Christians of Ukraine have celebrated Holy Week in the shadow of war, but much has changed for residents of Kyiv since last Easter. In the weeks before then, Ukrainian forces had driven Moscow's troops from the area around the capital, and the scale of the atrocities that emerged in the wake of the Russian retreat was still becoming apparent.In addition, the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year prompted an exodus from the capital. Though Easter week fell in late April after a semblance of normality had started to return, many of the city's residents remained absent.This year, thousands of men, women and children flocked to services for Palm Sunday, Good Friday and Easter Sunday at the large Orthodox churches in the capital and surrounding areas. The increased crowds are a reflection of the reality that, though fighting rages in eastern Ukraine, a relative calm has returned to the capital."On this day a year ago, we all prayed that Ukraine would endure," President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said in an overnight speech. "Today - for Ukraine to win."He filmed the speech at the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, or Monastery of the Caves, a network of churches that overlooks the Dnipro River and is a cradle of Christian Orthodoxy in Eastern Europe.In recent months, the authorities have moved against a branch of the church, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. It is linked to the Russian Orthodox Church, whose leader, Patriarch Kirill, has praised the war in Ukraine launched by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Ukraine's government has ordered the Moscow Patriarchate church to quit the parts of the Lavra that it uses, leading to a standoff at the site with protesters on both sides. The growing primacy of Ukraine's independent Orthodox church made Easter even more significant for some worshipers there.In one example, the Moscow Patriarchate church relinquished control of the Holy Dormition Cathedral to the government in January, and, on Sunday, Ukraine's independent church held its first-ever Easter service there."I'm not very religious, but this year is special," said Oleksandr Trokhymets, 40, a lawyer and a military officer who had come to a service at the cathedral with his daughter. "I want on this day to be here with Ukrainian people and Ukrainian priests."

        "The Phantom of the Opera" concluded the longest run in Broadway history Sunday night with a glittery final performance at which even the production's signature chandelier, which had just crashed onto the stage of the Majestic Theater for the 13,981st time, got its own curtain call.The invitation-only crowd was filled with Broadway lovers, including actors who had performed in the show over its 35-year run, as well as numerous other artists (including Lin-Manuel Miranda and Glenn Close) and fans who won a special ticket lottery. Some dressed in Phantom regalia; one man came dressed in the character's sumptuous Red Death costume.The final performance, which ran from 5:22 to 7:56 p.m., was interrupted repeatedly by applause, not only for the main actors, but also for beloved props, including a monkey music box, and scenic elements such as a gondola being rowed through a candelabra-adorned underground lake. After the final curtain, the stagehands who made the show's elaborate spectacle happen night after night, were invited onstage for a resounding round of applause."It's just amazing, really, what has happened," the composer, Andrew Lloyd Webber, who wrote the show's soaring score, said after the final curtain, as he dedicated the performance to his son Nicholas, who died three weeks ago.Lloyd Webber spoke alongside his longtime collaborator and the show's lead producer, Cameron Mackintosh. They invited alumni of the original Broadway production to join them onstage, and projected onto the theater's back wall pictures of deceased members of the original creative team, including its director, Hal Prince, as well as every actor who played the two lead roles (the Phantom as well as Christine, the young soprano who is his obsession).Toward the end of the evening, Mackintosh acknowledged the one-ton chandelier, which was lowered from the ceiling to a round of applause, and the crowd was showered with gold and silver metallic confetti, some of which dangled in ribbons from the chandelier.Hours before the curtain, fans gathered across the street, waving and taking pictures and hoping somehow to score a spare ticket. Among them was Lexie Luhrs, 25, of Washington, in a Phantom get-up: black cape, homemade mask, plus fedora, vest and bow tie, as well as mask earrings and a mask necklace. "I'm here to celebrate the show that means so much to us," Luhrs said.On Broadway "Phantom" was, obviously, enormously successful, playing to 20 million people and grossing $1.36 billion since its opening in January 1988. And the show has become an international phenomenon, playing in 17 languages in 45 countries and grossing more than $6 billion globally. But the Broadway run ultimately succumbed to the twin effects of inflation and dwindled tourism following the coronavirus pandemic shutdown.It closed on an unexpectedly high note - and not just the high E that Christine sings in the title song. As soon as the closing was announced last September, sales spiked, as those who already loved the musical flocked to see it, and procrastinators realized it could be their last chance; the original February closing date was delayed by two months to accommodate demand, and the show has once again become the highest-grossing on Broadway, playing to exuberant audiences, enjoying a burnished reputation, and bringing in more than $3 million a week."For a show to go out this triumphantly is almost unheard-of," said Mackintosh.After the final performance, the show's company and its alumni gathered for an invitation-only celebration at the Metropolitan Club, with the show's iconic mask projected onto a wall next to a marble staircase.The show, with music by Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Charles Hart, is still running in London, where the orchestra size was cut and the set was altered during the pandemic shutdown to reduce running costs, and it is also currently running in the Czech Republic, Japan, South Korea and Sweden. New productions are scheduled to open in China next month, in Italy in July and in Spain in October.And will it ever return to New York? "Of course, at some point," Mackintosh said in an interview. "But it is time for the show to have a rest."

        Ahmad Jamal, whose measured, spare piano style was an inspiration to generations of jazz musicians, died on Sunday at his home in Ashley Falls, Mass. He was 92.The cause was prostate cancer, his daughter, Sumayah Jamal, said.In a career that would bring him a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master award, a lifetime achievement Grammy and induction into France's Order of Arts and Letters, Mr. Jamal made his mark with a stately approach that honored what he called the spaces in the music. That approach stood in marked contrast to the challengingly complex music known as bebop, which was sweeping the jazz world when Mr. Jamal began his career as a teenager in the mid-1940s. Bebop pianists, following the lead of Bud Powell, became known for their virtuosic flurries of notes. Mr. Jamal chose a different path, which proved equally influential.The critic Stanley Crouch wrote that bebop's founding father, Charlie Parker, was the only musician "more important to the development of fresh form in jazz than Ahmad Jamal."In his early years, Mr. Jamal listened not just to jazz, which he preferred to call "American classical music," but also to classical music of the non-American variety. "We didn't separate the two schools," he told The New York Times in 2001. "We studied Bach and Ellington, Mozart and Art Tatum. When you start at 3, what you hear you play. I heard all these things."Mr. Jamal's laid-back, accessible style, with its dense chords, its wide dynamic range and above all its judicious use of silence, led to more than his share of dismissive reviews in the jazz press early in his career; Martin Williams's canonical history "The Jazz Tradition" described his music as "chic and shallow."But it soon became an integral part of the jazz landscape. Herbie Hancock and Keith Jarrett are among the prominent jazz pianists who looked to Mr. Jamal as an exemplar.Probably the best-known musician to cite Mr. Jamal as an influence was not a pianist but a trumpeter and bandleader: Miles Davis, who became close friends with Mr. Jamal, recorded his compositions and arrangements and would bring his sidemen to see Mr. Jamal perform. He once said, "All my inspiration comes from Ahmad Jamal."Ahmad Jamal was born Frederick Russell Jones in Pittsburgh on July 2, 1930. Fritz, as he was called, began playing piano at age 3 and began studying with Mary Cardwell Dawson, the founder of the National Negro Opera Company, a few years later. By the time he joined the musicians' union at age 14, the celebrated jazz piano virtuoso Art Tatum had hailed him as "a coming great," and he began touring with George Hudson's big band after graduating from high school.In 1950 he moved to Chicago, where he converted to Islam, changed his name to Ahmad Jamal and assembled a piano-guitar-bass trio known as the Three Strings. During an extended stay at the Manhattan nightclub the Embers in 1951, the trio came to the attention of the noted record producer and talent scout John Hammond, who signed them to the Okeh label.In 1955 Mr. Jamal recorded his first full-length album, "Ahmad Jamal Plays," with the guitarist Ray Crawford and the bassist Israel Crosby, for the small Parrot label. Tellingly, when the album was acquired and rereleased the next year by Argo, a subsidiary of the seminal blues label Chess, it was retitled "Chamber Music of the New Jazz."Mr. Jamal received his first major national exposure with the Argo album "At the Pershing: But Not for Me," recorded at a Chicago nightclub in 1958 with Mr. Crosby and the drummer Vernel Fournier. It spent more than two years on the Billboard album chart, an all but unheard-of stretch for a jazz album.The success of "At the Pershing" stemmed in part from Mr. Jamal's ambling yet propulsive interpretation of the standard "Poinciana," still his best-known recording. But he received some criticism for not including any original compositions on the album, which he later said spurred him to focus on writing his own music.Mr. Jamal's output was as prodigious as his light-fingered style was economical: He released as many as three albums a year in the late 1960s and early '70s, and more than 60 in his career. He also founded a handful of record labels, a management company and a Chicago nightclub and restaurant called the Alhambra, although that venture lasted less than a year. In keeping with his religious beliefs, the Alhambra did not serve alcohol, which presumably hastened its demise.The Alhambra's financial difficulties marked the beginning of a dark period of Mr. Jamal's life, in which he walked away from performing for almost three years. The club closed in December 1961; three months later, he filed for divorce from Maryam Jamal, formerly named Virginia Wilkins, whom he had married when he was 17. Five years of court action followed, during which Mr. Jamal was arrested and charged with nonpayment of child support for their daughter. (He was later cleared.) He was hospitalized in 1963 after an apparent overdose of sleeping pills. Not until 1964 did he begin touring and recording again.He married first as a teenager, and that marriage ended in divorce. He married Sharifah Frazier, the mother of Sumayah, in the early 1960s, and they divorced in 1982. He married Laura Hess-Hay, his manager, the same year, and they divorced in 1984, though she continued to represent him until his death. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by two grandchildren.Live recordings often captured Mr. Jamal at his nimblest, and many jazz connoisseurs rank such albums as "Freeflight" (1971), recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival, and "Chicago Revisited: Live at Joe Segal's Jazz Showcase" (1993) among his best. In 2011, Mosaic Records released a nine-CD boxed set consisting of the 12 albums he recorded for Argo between 1956 and 1962. His album "Blue Moon," a well-received collection of originals and standards, was released in 2012 and nominated for a Grammy Award. His album "Marseille" was released in 2017 and "Ballades" in 2019.Last year Mr. Jamal released two separate double-disc collections: "Emerald City Nights: Live at the Penthouse (1963-64)" and "(1965-66)," consisting of previously unreleased live recordings made in Seattle. A third set, "(1966-68)," is planned. The reverence with which Mr. Jamal was held stretched well beyond the jazz world. Clint Eastwood used two tracks from "But Not for Me" on the soundtrack of his film of "The Bridges of Madison County." But the more extensive tributes have come from the world of hip-hop. Tracks like De La Soul's "Stakes Is High" and Nas's "The World Is Yours," along with dozens of other rap songs, have sampled Mr. Jamal's piano riffs.As infectious as those riffs were, it was ballads that held the strongest appeal to Mr. Jamal. Like many other interpreters of the standard repertoire, he made a point of learning the lyrics to the songs he played. He spoke approvingly to The Times in 2001 about a conversation he once had with a great jazz saxophonist who was also known for his way with a ballad."I once heard Ben Webster playing his heart out on a ballad," he said. "All of a sudden he stopped. I asked him, 'Why did you stop, Ben?' He said, 'I forgot the lyrics.'"

        Most Japanese schoolchildren know the kappa as a trickster who looks like a cross between a frog and a turtle with an indented head. If you're not careful, it could drag you into the river to drown. The tengu, identifiable by its bright red face and long nose, lurks in the woods. Beware of the tanuki, a supernatural variation of a raccoon dog, for it may make a fool of you when it crosses your path.These mischievous, occasionally demonic, spooks of traditional Japanese folklore are known collectively as yokai. They once helped explain mysterious phenomena, such as noises in the night, missing food, or the rains and winds that damaged property. Now, as shared cultural heritage, they are ubiquitous in fairy tales, cartoons, advertising, television and film.Yet what truly distinguishes the yokai of Japan is that they are not frozen in classical legend or restricted to a narrow roster of familiar characters. Rather, each generation invents new yokai, many of them channeling a collective unconscious of present-day anxieties.This infinitely expanding pantheon of mythological creatures is well in evidence on Shodoshima, a small island in Japan's Seto Inland Sea, where residents host an art contest and invite entrants to let their imaginations run wild as they create new yokai for the modern era.One of the winners in the competition, held last month, was a furry blue critter with bright red hearts glowing in its eye sockets. Its creator, Rika Nakamichi, said it embodied the current obsession for collecting approval on social media.Among the entries from previous contests, now collected in a museum on the island, was a pair of reptilian high heels bristling with rows of teeth. That creature recalled a recent campaign urging Japanese employers to stop requiring female workers to wear high heels. Another was a lizard with a long tongue that licked off the faces of subway riders in thrall to their cellphones.Many cultures have folkloric creatures believed to live beyond the physical world, causing mayhem or terror or simple amusement. Think of the leprechaun of Ireland, the puckish forest-dwelling aluxe of Mexico, or the grisly krasue of Southeast Asia, a woman whose internal organs hang exposed from her neck down. Variations on mermaids, fairies and elves crop up throughout the world.In Japan, yokai are characterized by the spirit of invention. "Anything can be made into a yokai, even things that we don't know exist yet," said Kazuhiko Komatsu, professor emeritus of cultural anthropology at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in Kyoto and the author of "An Introduction to Yokai Culture: Monsters, Ghosts and Outsiders in Japanese History."Shodoshima's contest, founded a decade ago, was staged in March for the first time since before the coronavirus pandemic, with judges now free to gather on the island to select the winners. Professional artists and hobbyists from across Japan submitted 75 ghoulish and playful sculptures, down from 243 entrants in 2013, the competition's first year.Along with the blue "likes" monster, the finalists included a sickly green yokai that invades your mouth if you fail to brush your teeth. A yokai that looked like an aardvark covered in kanji, the Chinese pictographs used in Japanese writing, expressed the artist's fear that these characters might disappear from a culture where everyone types phonetically on a smartphone."Different artists have rules within themselves of what they think yokai are," said Chubei Yagyu, 46, a local artist and contest judge whose father, Yoshihiko, 70, a prominent businessman on the island, finances the competition. "Creating new yokai is what is great about this contest."The Yokai Art Museum, also founded by the Yagyus, has now amassed more than 900 googly-eyed, scaly, multi-legged creatures. The museum is lodged in four restored Meiji-era wooden buildings in an area of crisscrossing streets known as the island's "maze" district.Shuji Sato, manager of the yokai contest and museum, said he hoped the yokai activities would fuel a tourist boom on Shodoshima and help the island compete with Naoshima, a popular art-focused islet also in the Seto Inland Sea. That better-known destination draws travelers who come to see the iconic Yayoi Kusama polka-dotted pumpkins and the Benesse House Museum, designed by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando.On the island, it is easy to imagine yokai skulking just beyond the eye's reach. A small shrine carved into stacked rocks overlooking the sea appears as though it could conceal spirits that emerge at night. The gnarled branches of a 1,600-year-old juniper tree form a fire-breathing dragon.Scholars trace the yokai's roots to literary or artistic references as early as the 11th century. In addition to offering explanations for strange events, the yokai could be thought of as objects that had come to life, in keeping with Japan's early animist beliefs."Japanese people feel relieved once you put a name to something," said Mitsuo Takeda, a judge of the Shodoshima contest and an artist who designed a large installation featuring a bug-eyed yokai large enough to walk through. "If you are pulling grass and you get a cut and you wonder what happened," he said, "if you think, 'Oh, it is just a yokai,' you feel calmer."A significant popularizer of yokai was the 18th-century scholar and artist known as Toriyama Sekien, who compiled an encyclopedia of creatures drawn from his imagination.In the modern era, the manga artist Shigeru Mizuki's "Ge Ge Ge no Kitaro" series spawned a world of new yokai characters that have inspired subsequent generations of yokai cartoonists and fans.Japanese popular culture is littered with descendants of the early yokai, including the characters of the Pokémon universe and the phantasmagoric creatures of Hayao Miyazaki's imagination, such as Totoro or the bathhouse sprites of "Spirited Away." More recently, yokai influences can be seen in the monsters of "Demon Slayer," the smash-hit comic book, television series and movie.During the pandemic, artists on social media adopted the amabie, a 19th-century yokai that is said to predict epidemics and resembles a mermaid with a bird's beak. Even Japan's health ministry used the amabie as a mascot on coronavirus-related public health bulletins.On Shodoshima, Mr. Yagyu said that as a child, he was entranced by Mizuki's manga and believed that yokai existed in the real world."I really thought if I kept drawing yokai myself, they would come out to see me," he said. Today, Mr. Yagyu sells paintings and takes commissions to invent new yokai based on a client's personality.Eiji Ishibashi, who with his wife, Makiko, and twin daughters, Mai and Mei, 23, have entered several contests on Shodoshima since 2013, said the family envisions their yokai projects as a way to express "things that you are struggling with or things that you aspire to."This year, the family crafted a parade of yokai emerging from an upside-down gate that symbolized a portal to an unseen world. Some looked ominous, such as a gape-mouthed green and yellow blob with two tiny legs dangling from the roof of its mouth. Others were cute, such as the baseball-size head with multiple eyeballs and a giant nose.Mai Ishibashi said the yokai represented "many things that we now see as a society that we did not see before Covid."Ms. Nakamichi, 35, an artist known as Ikka who created the heart-eyed yokai, said she wanted to play with the idea that yokai could be both cute and scary. "If you meet my yokai, your Instagram post may go viral," she said. "But you may get sucked in and addicted to the validation, so this yokai has an evil side, too."On the day of the final judging last month, eight judges, including a professional doll maker, an anime studio director and a collector of tin toys, gathered to inspect and rank the 32 finalists. Six artists received cash prizes, and all entrants will be displayed in the museum, where a back room stuffed with sculptures from previous years evokes the prop house for a science-fiction movie.Daisuke Yanasawa, a judge and the founder of Kayac, a web and app design company, said he foresaw a long future for the prize entrants."The new modern yokai that won," he said, "may become part of the regular yokai vernacular 100 years from now."

        I don't enjoy doing household chores. More than that, I don't enjoy completing menial tasks in general, or doing one thing for more than 30 minutes, or pushing myself past the point of minor inconvenience. That said, like most people, I do enjoy a clean and comfortable home - or at least the type of home I can invite friends over without wincing as they step over clutter and shoe mud in the hallway. When you live in a small London apartment, as I do, one forgotten plate or hastily flung coat can make the whole place feel chaotic.These facts might appear irreconcilable. You can't sink into a bubble bath without running the water first. But when it comes to household chores specifically, there may be one solution that combines productivity with an anti-productivity spirit. Some describe it breaking a task into manageable chunks. I like to call it slow cleaning - the act of cleaning a little bit, every day, or even just sometimes, whenever you feel able.Slow cleaning can best be defined as an anti-spring clean. Instead of doing an intense and time-consuming seasonal clean, which you might avoid until the mess feels unmanageable, you divide the labor into miniature, almost unnoticeable tasks that can be done often. For example, you might vacuum the stairs before meeting friends, fold the laundry before watching a movie, or clean the bathroom floor while dinner's in the oven. As time passes, the tasks add up, until you have a clean house without feeling as though you've done, well, anything at all. (And yes, even the knottier, deep clean tasks can be tackled with this approach. Need to do a full degrease of the oven? Try it one morning while listening to a podcast - just that, absolutely nothing else. Don't even load the dishwasher.)I am by no means the first to float this particular concept. Housework and productivity experts alike have long endorsed the idea that, in order to get anything done, it needs to feel both manageable and actionable. But most productivity techniques (the Pomodoro technique, the 52/17 rule, the two-minute rule) tend to focus on exactly how prolific of a taskmaster you can be, with the energy and time that you have. I like to think of slow cleaning as more of an anti-productivity, pro-pleasure practice. Instead of stressing over what needs to be done, it's more about focusing on what you can or want to do - within reason. The world isn't going to implode if you don't disinfect every single surface in your home, or if you'd rather read a good book than organize your drawers today. You can vacuum later, if there's time.This more casual approach to cleaning is becoming increasingly popular, particularly online. Maxwell Ryan, founder of Apartment Therapy, a home and lifestyle platform that regularly advocates for breaking chores into bite-size chunks, believes we've seen a mass attitude shift when it comes to housework. Where older generations might have prided themselves on keeping fancy homes, with strict cleaning calendars à la Martha Stewart, it's now more about doing what you can, with what you've got. When people are renting cramped apartments, working from home and often living paycheck to paycheck, something as simple as tidying a bedroom floor can feel like enough."If you go on TikTok, there are a whole bunch of hashtags for #sundaycore, #cleanwithme, that sort of stuff," said Ryan. "You're seeing people who are making their bed or cleaning a window, and their homes are modest. There's a message there, too, which is: it doesn't have to be fancy. In fact, that would stress me out. It's about accessible homes and people sharing clean, well-lit spaces that are not fancy."Indeed, at a time in which phrases like "quiet-quitting," "burnout" and "anti-ambition" have entered our everyday lexicon in reaction to the hustle culture of previous decades, it makes sense that we're taking less of a perfectionist approach to our homes. Scroll through TikTok and you'll be met with endless clips of people briefly tidying their "depressed rooms" or spending their Sunday cleaning what they can, despite having busy schedules. The onus isn't on productivity or precision, per se, but on looking after your home to the best of your ability, at any given time.This is something that Kenika Williams, a professional organizer and founder of Tidied by K, has also noticed, particularly during the pandemic, as her customers began working from home. "I think the power of having a functional home is something that's being more understood now," she said. "The focus is now shifting to 'I just want our home to work for us. It doesn't have to feel luxurious for anyone else.' It omits this feeling of 'keeping up with the Joneses.' Everyone is just trying to manage day-to-day and be at peace. I think that's super powerful."Dr. Tim Pychyl, retired psychologist and author of "Solving the Procrastination Puzzle," said as soon as we're too abstract ("spring cleaning"), we risk making a task feel "aversive," which can trigger our amygdala's procrastination response."Studies have shown that when we speak about things concretely, they belong to today, they have a sense of urgency to them," said Dr. Pychyl. "When we think about things abstractly - like 'Oh, I have to clean'- they belong to tomorrow. The concreteness is partly what's nudging you in the right direction. 'It's only going to take a minute for me to wipe this floor' becomes no big deal."Doing less often means more, too. Chris Bailey, a productivity consultant and author of "The Productivity Project," found that when he decided on three important things to do that day, instead of an endless list, he was better able to make traction. "I call it the 'rule of three'," he said. "You ask yourself, 'What are the three main things I want to have accomplished by the time the day is done?' The idea is because you only get to pick three, you have to really choose what is essential on a given day. You choose way more things that you don't dedicate your time, attention and energy to."So next time you feel the pressure to do a huge spring clean, why not just tidy the kitchen cupboards and save the rest for another day? The number of goals you can tick off a to-do list bears no relation to the moral fabric of your character. And remember: There's always tomorrow.

        It is a cold day in northeastern New Jersey, and Jessica Holoka is carefully taking inventory around the home she shares with her husband of 11 years. She is not planning to move, nor is she preparing for doomsday. She's gearing up for her annual spring cleaning marathon, some three months away.Ms. Holoka, 41, does not take spring cleaning lightly. It involves about a week of backbreaking work. The blinds, windows and trim must be washed, the rugs shampooed, the ceiling fans cleaned, the bathroom - including the tiles and grout - scrubbed to perfection, the refrigerator cleaned out and the smoke detectors checked. To top it all off, the paint throughout the home must be touched up. In a good year, her car might get a thorough cleaning, too.Ms. Holoka said her husband, Mike Holoka, usually hangs out in the garage or assigns himself yard work for that week, while she spends a few hours each day tackling various tasks.Odds are she'll have plenty of company. Spring cleaning has its roots in a dirtier time, when people heated their homes by burning wood and, later, coal, and the end of winter meant scrubbing surfaces caked with soot and dirt. The tradition endures today as an annual ritual of purification and renewal - a time to purge old clothing, shred junk mail, donate unwanted food and clear the gutters."I'm a self-proclaimed clean freak, a female Danny Tanner," Ms. Holoka said, referring to Bob Saget's character from the sitcom "Full House." "I prefer to do it alone. I feel like everybody has a certain way that they clean."Ms. Holoka, a lifestyle blogger, shares recipes and do-it-yourself projects on her website, livinglavidaholoka.com. She said she never feels overwhelmed by the volume of work that awaits her each spring because she has prepared for it, and because she keeps a well-stocked cleaning kit.The idea of an annual deep cleaning is not new, but it's not possible to assign a date to when the tradition began, said Susan Strasser, a historian and the author of "Never Done: A History of American Housework."Before the 20th century, all light and heat in households came from burning fuels, Ms. Strasser said, and before kerosene and coal, people heated their homes with fires. That meant that by the end of winter there was soot and dust all over the house. "People who valued cleanliness at all really had to clean up in the spring, because the winter left places really dirty," she said.For some, spring cleaning takes place around the time of the vernal equinox, which this year fell on March 20. Others take their cues from nature, choosing to break out the sponges and brooms when the trees begin budding and the flowers begin blooming. Some Jewish families do a type of spring cleaning, principally in the kitchen, in preparation for Passover.The number of Americans who do some sort of spring cleaning appears to be rising. A survey by the American Cleaning Institute, which represents producers of household and industrial cleaning products, found that 78 percent of Americans did an annual spring cleaning last year, up about 10 percent from 2021.On social media, there is a sharp divide between people who love to clean and those who despise it. On TikTok, videos tagged "cleantok," many of which show cleaning tips and hacks, have received nearly 27 billion views. On Facebook, there are groups where people vent about their hatred of cleaning, and on Twitter, a search for "I hate cleaning" returned hundreds of tweets from people complaining about having to tidy their kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms.Among them was Hugo Martinez, 22, a student at the University of Texas at Austin, who shared his frustrations about cleaning on Twitter in early February. He said in an interview that, for him, cleaning was tied to his emotions, and that the tidiness of his home reflected that."I feel like everything is mental," he said. "If you're not in a good mental state," then it's unlikely that spring cleaning will happen.Grace Reynolds, president and chief executive of the American House Cleaners Association, a membership organization that raises awareness of the necessity of cleaning and the skills it involves, said it could be "mentally draining" for many people."It's an acquired skill and a lot of people have not acquired it," she said. Some people experience guilt over it, while others don't have the time, particularly those who are working or managing children, she said.Complaints on the subject are well documented. In 1866, Emily Dickinson wrote in a letter: "'House' is being 'cleaned.' I prefer pestilence." Nellie Kedzie Jones, a pioneer in home economics who taught "domestic science" at several universities in the late 1800s and early 1900s, wrote that spring cleaning was an "abomination of desolation" and that the task "breaks women's backs and causes men to break the Ten Commandments."House cleaning is "the kind of work that we just don't think of," Ms. Strasser, the author and historian, said, in part because women traditionally have done the bulk of it.In an earlier time, before the turn of the last century, heavy curtains that were used to insulate a home during the winter would be removed, she said. Walls would be whitewashed, and carpets would be removed and beaten. Chimneys would be swept out and the windows thoroughly cleaned. If a household could afford help, either from enslaved people or servants, they would be enlisted as well, she said."You start on the top floor and one by one, literally, take the rooms apart," Ms. Strasser said.In modern times, few people take their spring cleaning to such extremes. But Rajiv Surendra, a calligrapher, domestic arts specialist and actor ("Mean Girls"), relishes his cleaning ritual.Mr. Surendra, who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, has a YouTube channel where he teaches the art of living well, offering tips on how to iron a shirt, for example, or how to properly wash whites."I don't believe there is a more effective way of cleaning the floor than being on your hands and knees, what I call 'Cinderella style,'" Mr. Surendra said. "I do a full, full clean twice a year."Mr. Surendra said the process, which includes precariously maneuvering himself to clean the outside of the windows of his one-bedroom apartment, takes him about a week."For the week that I'm cleaning, I feel like I'm not living, like I pressed the pause button," he said. But his cleaning routine is inexpensive. The biggest cost is his time, as he typically sets aside commissions or projects to focus on cleaning.He also recommends decluttering. As he cleans, he makes a point of touching every item in his possession at least once, he says. Anything left behind, he said, needs to be washed, polished, vacuumed or dusted."Clean smells really good," he said. "My smell of clean is not something that's associated with a product. It's this emptiness. It's space. It also feels like peace."

        Good morning. A while back, Kay Chun developed a great recipe for manicotti (above) designed for weeknight cooking. But for a Sunday supper, I skip the store-bought marinara and instead make Marcella Hazan's Bolognese sauce to drench the stuffed pasta. It's more work to do that, to be sure, but it's work I enjoy - labor exchanged for smiles and conversation with friends and family.That's the plan I'm starting with today, anyway. Sometimes there are no manicotti shells at the market. If that's the case, I'll burble up some Sunday sauce and serve it with riggs and herbed garlic bread. Cheesecake for dessert? I think so, yes, either way.As for the rest of the week. …Mark Bittman's recipe for pasta with mint and Parmesan is an absolute classic: a rich combination of butter and cheese that uses a copious amount of mint to leave the dish light and refreshing. And if you happen to have some leftover lobster meat in the fridge (as one sometimes does!) and a stray jalapeño? Make like a restaurant chef and chop those into the sauce. You won't be sorry.Puntas al albañil is a saucy Mexican dish made with beef and bacon in a thick, fire-roasted salsa. Pati Jinich uses it as the basis for a recipe for these bricklayer-style nachos, with melted Monterey Jack (at least in my version), crumbly queso fresco, plenty of avocado and sliced scallions.I don't know that I'd ask for it seated in the dining room of Bamonte's in Brooklyn, but Kay Chun's recipe for tofu Marsala with asparagus is an impressive vegetarian take on the Italian American classic, and the asparagus makes it a beautiful early-spring meal.Ali Slagle's recipe for one-pot tortellini in a garlicky tomato sauce with sausage is perfect for the frozen tortellini I have stashed in the freezer (alongside bags of tteokmyeon and boxes of Jamaican beef patties).Arthur Schwartz, the maven of Jewish food in New York, made fun of my recipe for chicken paprikash because of the attention I pay to the crispness of the chicken skin, and for the recipe's inclusion of sour cream, which for those who keep kosher makes the dish tref. But, hey, seven years in? Six thousand ratings. Five stars!Thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this week are awaiting you on New York Times Cooking, at least if you have a subscription. Subscriptions are necessary. They make our work possible. If you haven't taken one out already, I hope you will subscribe today. Thank you.More housekeeping. Write us at cookingcare@nytimes.com if you run into trouble with our technology. Write me at foodeditor@nytimes.com if you'd like to pay a compliment or raise a complaint. (Here's one now: I somehow managed to misspell Deborah Solomon's name on Friday, when I pointed out her amazing Picasso essay in The Times. Apologies.)Now, it's nothing whatsoever to do with scapes or lamb chops, but today is the birthday of the 19th-century painter Ford Madox Brown, as good a time as any to spend some time looking at and thinking about what may be his most important painting, "Work," at the Manchester Art Gallery in England. Very Hogarth.You should read Charles Gaines in Garden & Gun this month: "An Alabama Kidnapping That's Stranger Than Fiction." True crime in Birmingham.Also, a previously unpublished short story by Laurie Colwin in The New Yorker, "Evensong." A love affair!Finally, why don't you listen to P.J. Harvey's "Maniac" while you're cooking that manicotti tonight? It's credit music for a prestige television series, and you're the showrunner. Have a great week. I'll be back on Friday.

        When you host one of the world's last over-the-air radio shows in Yiddish, fans occasionally get in touch. But you hear more often from critics. They write to Avraham Zaks, the 37-year-old behind the mic of a weekly program called "We Are Here!" to nitpick about his grammar. Or to complain about his accent, which doesn't sound sufficiently Eastern European to their ears. Some tell him the show needs more religious content.Mr. Zaks, who has flecks of gray in his beard and warm dark eyes and wears wire-rim glasses, does not mind. On some level, he is kind of tickled by the feedback."I write and say: 'Thank you very much, we're doing our best. It's nice to hear that you're listening,'" he said on a Wednesday afternoon, just minutes before his show started. "The problem in broadcasting generally is that most of the time, you don't get any reaction. You feel like you're speaking to yourself.""We Are Here!" is one of a handful of niche language radio offerings of Kan, Israel's public media network, officially known as the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation.Most of the company's 1,000 employees run a highly regarded TV, radio and digital news division or oversee the production of some of the country's most prestigious television shows, some of which air on U.S. streaming platforms. As Israel's answer to the BBC or PBS, Kan, whose headquarters is in Jerusalem, is more interested in gravity than ratings.These days, Kan has a new focus: survival. It sits squarely in the cross hairs of Israel's right-wing government elected in November. Through Shlomo Karhi, the minister of communications, the government has issued a number of threats against the network, starting with a vow to defund the company and shut it down."There is no place in this day and age for a public broadcaster when there is a wide range of channels," Mr. Karhi said during a news conference in January.In case anyone thought he was talking exclusively about saving taxpayer money - Kan receives the equivalent of $180 million a year from Israel's coffers, about 85 percent of the company's budget - he also accused the media more broadly of being "too biased toward the left."A few weeks later, a spokesman for Mr. Karhi said in a statement that the closure of Kan was delayed "until further notice" so that the government could concentrate on overhauling the judiciary, a plan that has convulsed the nation.More recently, the minister said he wanted to strip Kan of three of its eight radio spectrums, which are needed for radio stations. The station broadcasting "We Are Here!" is expected to survive any cull because an Israeli regulation requires foreign language broadcasting in this nation of immigrants. The fear among Kan's supporters is that once the government is done with the judiciary overhaul, whether its plans end with success or failure, the network is next."If you're looking for a textbook on how to turn a democracy into an autocracy, it includes shutting down independent media," said Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, who drafted Kan's journalistic code of ethics. The media market in Israel, a country of 10 million people, is small by American standards and highly competitive. There are four TV networks in total. The other three are privately held and Kan is generally in a tie for fourth place in the ratings race with Channel 14. That network, often called Israel's version of Fox News, enthusiastically supports the Netanyahu administration. In recent months, according to the network, it has enjoyed a ratings surge.Political leaders in Israel, like those in virtually every country, try to influence and shape news coverage. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seems especially eager to manage the media. Two of the three corruption trials against him involve quid pro quos for favorable coverage from powerful publishers - one the owner of a large daily newspaper and the other a telecom tycoon who operates a popular online news site. (Mr. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing.)"The coalition is not interested in the standard pushback game we've seen in the past," said Shuki Tausig, chief editor of The Seventh Eye, a media watchdog publication. "They want to use regulations to weaken, or even smash, big commercial players that are not obeying them. And they want to eliminate or control Kan."The network is the successor to the Israel Broadcasting Authority, which was closed in 2017 after critics from across the political spectrum concluded that its programming was shabby and the authority too easily buffeted by politicians, who appointed its board members and controlled its budget.Kan has been designed for imperviousness to partisanship, relatively speaking; the job of selecting board members is up to industry professionals. It's a structure that has produced a catalog of highly compelling television, including a three-part documentary about Adolph Eichmann, "The Devil's Confession," available on Amazon Prime and bankrolled by a number of companies. Last month, Kan was nominated for 125 Ophir Awards, Israel's version of the Oscars and Emmys, more than double its nearest rival."All the other networks are trying to make a profit so they are filled with shows where people are on an island for three weeks fighting over a bag of rice," said Tsuriel Rashi, senior lecturer at Ariel University's School of Communication. The Eichmann documentary, he added, was "a huge undertaking.""It's expensive, and it won't make money," he said, "but it's important."Kan is in an office building in a generic patch in Jerusalem, not far from an ultra Orthodox neighborhood and near the Israel Tax Authority. During a recent visit, the place hummed with reporters readying an evening broadcast. In the Arab media room, a handful of employees were watching dozens of televisions broadcasting from around the Middle East."Today is kind of quiet," said a reporter with his eyes trained on the screens. "There was a machine gun fired into the air in Gaza, which set off sirens in Israel, but no rockets.""I've seen scarier things in my professional life," one of his colleagues said.Despite the business-as-usual vibe here, morale has sagged, as it would at any institution facing extinction."We had a companywide meeting a few weeks ago, and I told everyone, 'I know there are people here who go home at night and have children ask if they will have a job in the morning,'" Gil Omer, chairman of the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, said in an interview at Kan's offices. "And I told them that we will do everything we can to keep this place alive."For now, the government appears to have scaled back its ambitions to those three radio spectrums, which it plans to make available to commercial networks.It's not a measure Mr. Karhi could take unilaterally. Yoaz Hendel, his predecessor as minister of communications, said in an interview that Mr. Karhi did not seem to understand the job, which has nothing to do with Kan's budget - that's the finance ministry's purview - and is all about building communications infrastructure, like 5G."Karhi could announce tomorrow that all Israelis need to wear red hats, but that doesn't mean anyone would listen to him," Mr. Hendel said. "He should focus on what he was appointed to do, which is to make sure that Israel is well-connected."Elad Malka, the vice director general at the Ministry of Communications, disagreed. "The minister in charge of public broadcasting is the minister of communications," he said. "Of course, if there are changes that the minister wants, he needs to go to the Knesset," Mr. Malka added, referring to Israel's Parliament.Even if he lacks the authority to unplug Kan on his own, Mr. Karhi, a former member of the Knesset, has grabbed national attention in Israel because his statements appear to reflect the will of the government. And grabbing attention is one of Mr. Karhi's specialties. In February, he denounced critics of the judicial overhaul plan as "erav rav," an ancient term for demons who pose as Jews and must be killed. In early March, during the Jewish holiday of Purim, he tweeted a message wishing everyone well - except for reservists soldiers opposed to the judicial overhaul, who he said could "go to hell.""He has no interest in media," Mr. Tausig said. "His actions as minister are just political opportunism, a way to demonstrate he's more extreme than extreme, to serve Netanyahu."A spokesman for the Ministry of Communications declined to comment.Mr. Zaks, the host of "We Are Here!," has closely followed the drama that has engulfed his employer, but one recent Wednesday afternoon he was more interested on his upcoming interview with the head of the Yiddish Department at Hebrew University.They discussed how to attract Israel's ultra Orthodox to evenings of Yiddish theater and literature, a major challenge given that much of the canon is downright irreligious. Reaching the Haredi, or ultra Orthodox, community is important to Mr. Zaks, who was raised in a Lubavitcher community outside Tel Aviv. By the time he was 20, he realized that he was an atheist and left. He spent the next few years discovering popular culture that he had never encountered - television, movies, professional sports."I knew about radio because it was on all day at home," he said. "That was it."The biggest group of Yiddish speakers in Israel are Haredi, but he assumes they are a tiny percent of the audience for "We Are Here!" because it's a secular show. He knows, however, that every year a few thousand exit the ultra Orthodox community and he's happy to offer them some connection to the world they have left behind."It's like being an émigré and reading a newspaper in the language you were raised in," he said. "I don't love the place that I left, but I love Yiddish. It's a heritage that we have to keep."

        Four people were killed and 28 others were injured in a shooting at a birthday party on Saturday night in an Alabama city, officials said.Sgt. Jeremy Burkett, a spokesman for the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, said that the shooting in Dadeville took place around 10:34 p.m. At news conferences on Sunday, the authorities did not provide information about who opened fire or why.The shooting occurred at the Mahogany Masterpiece dance studio, The Montgomery Advertiser reported. Dadeville is about 60 miles northeast of Montgomery, and about 3,000 people live there.The studio hosted Zumba and line dancing classes for children and teenagers and had been rehearsing for a dance showcase celebrating its second anniversary on April 29, according to its Facebook page. A representative of the studio could not be immediately reached on Sunday.At least 15 teenagers were treated for gunshot wounds, said Heidi Smith, a spokeswoman for Lake Martin Community Hospital in Dadeville.She said that nine of the teenagers were transferred to a different hospital to receive a higher level of care and that five of those nine were in critical condition. There were 17 ambulances on the scene after the shooting, Ms. Smith said.Residents on Sunday morning grappled with the shooting, which took place at a 16th birthday party, said Ben Hayes, the senior pastor at Dadeville First Baptist Church, who is also the chaplain of the city's Police Department.Philstavious Dowdell, a Dadeville High School football player who was known as Phil and who had committed to Jacksonville State University, was one of those killed, the pastor said.Mr. Dowdell was 18, and it was his younger sister's birthday party, according to Michael Taylor, a coach at Dadeville High School.He said that Mr. Dowdell's sister was a cheerleader who cheered for every sport at the high school and that many of the athletes she had supported came out to celebrate."They're all like family, like brothers and sisters in a small town," Mr. Taylor said. "This whole town is just in disbelief, like it's a dream."The head coach of Jacksonville State University's football team, Rich Rodriguez, said in a statement that Mr. Dowdell was a "great young man with a bright future."KeKe Nicole Smith, 18, a volleyball player and team manager for the Dadeville High School track team, was also killed, Mr. Taylor said. Ms. Smith's cousin, Amy Jackson, confirmed her death in a Facebook message. Mr. Taylor, who coached the track team Ms. Smith managed, described her as "full of life.""She was so fun and funny," he said. "A typical 18-year-old."The superintendent of the Tallapoosa County Board of Education, Raymond Porter, said at the news conference that schools would provide counseling to students on Monday. "We will make every effort to comfort those children," Mr. Porter said.Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama said on Twitter on Sunday morning that her office was receiving updates about the shooting."This morning, I grieve with the people of Dadeville and my fellow Alabamians," the governor said. "Violent crime has NO place in our state, and we are staying closely updated by law enforcement as details emerge."President Biden was briefed on the shooting, and he and his staff have been in contact with local law enforcement and officials to offer support, White House officials said."What has our nation come to when children cannot attend a birthday party without fear?" the president said in a statement. "This is outrageous and unacceptable," he added.Guns are the leading killer of children in the United States, making it an extreme outlier compared with similarly large and wealthy nations. In 2020, gun violence surpassed car accidents and disease to become the leading killer of children.The gun death rate for children in the United States is nearly five in every 100,000. The rate had been flat for more than a decade starting in 2000 and started to creep up in 2014. Researchers who study gun violence say that it is difficult to explain why the rate has risen so quickly, but most emphasize that the proliferation of guns has most likely played a role.Mr. Taylor said that at Dadeville High School, where many of the victims were students, classes would be in session on Monday. He was already trying to figure out what to say to the students who would show up."Bottom line, we've got to pray our way out of this and give it time," Mr. Taylor said. "That's the only way out."

        Elon Musk's silver-hued vision for sending humans to the moon and Mars is standing next to a 480-foot launch tower in the southern corner of Texas. It's a new SpaceX rocket called Starship that is more powerful than any vehicle that has traveled to space.As early as Monday morning, SpaceX will try to launch the Starship prototype to space for the first time."We're actually dying to get this rocket off the ground," Mr. Musk said on Sunday night during an audio discussion with users of Twitter.Here's what you need to know about the flight.Starship and the Super Heavy booster that will carry it to orbit are scheduled to be loaded with propellants early on Monday morning at a SpaceX test site in Texas, just outside the city of Brownsville. The launch site, which SpaceX calls Starbase, is close to the Gulf of Mexico.SpaceX has scheduled the flight as early as 9 a.m. Eastern time, and it could launch any time between then and 10:30 a.m. The company had earlier said it would the launch as early as 8 a.m.SpaceX said it would begin a livestream on its YouTube channel 45 minutes before the rocket is ready to liftoff.If problems arise and SpaceX is not able to launch on Monday, it will continue to try throughout the week. While the launch site appeared hazy on Sunday afternoon, SpaceX said the weather looked "pretty good for tomorrow morning but we're keeping an eye on wind shear."But Mr. Musk set low expectations for Monday's launch, suggesting it was likely to be called off for technical reasons."There's a good chance that it gets postponed since we're going to be pretty careful about this launch," he said. "If it does go wrong, there's a lot to go wrong."It is the tallest rocket ever built - 394 feet tall, or nearly 90 feet taller than the Statue of Liberty including the pedestal.And it has the most engines ever in a rocket booster: The Super Heavy, the lower section that will propel the upper Starship vehicle to orbit, has 33 of SpaceX's powerful Raptor engines sticking out of its bottom. They are able to generate 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, far more than the Saturn V that carried the Apollo astronauts to the moon.Starship is designed to be entirely reusable. The Super Heavy booster is to land much like those for SpaceX's smaller Falcon 9 rockets, and Starship will be able to return from space belly-flopping through the atmosphere like a sky diver before pivoting to a vertical position for landing.SpaceX's current Falcon 9 rocket is the most frequently launched rocket in the world. It has launched to space 24 times in 2023, most recently on Friday night.Starship is the next step. It would be able to carry far more cargo and many more people than Falcon 9. And because it is fully reusable, Starship could greatly reduce the cost of launching payloads to orbit.NASA is paying SpaceX to build a version of the vehicle to carry astronauts from lunar orbit to the moon's surface for the Artemis III and IV missions later in the decade. The spacecraft is also central to Mr. Musk's vision of sending people to Mars.For Monday's test flight, Starship will fly part of the way around the Earth, starting from Texas and splashing down in waters off Hawaii.Eventually SpaceX hopes to regularly land both the Super Heavy booster and Starship orbital vehicle to reuse them for future launches. But the spacecraft for Monday's flight will crash in the ocean and sink. They are meant as a first test of the vehicles, and the data will enable engineers to fix what does not work and make improvements.Mr. Musk on Sunday night said a key goal of the flight was to get the rocket a good distance from the launch site without something going wrong."Just don't blow up the launchpad," he said.About eight minutes after Monday's launch, the Super Heavy booster will splash into the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship vehicle will fly higher into space, reaching an altitude of about 150 miles and traveling around the Earth before re-entering the atmosphere. If it survives re-entry, about 90 minutes after launching, it will splash into the Pacific Ocean some 62 miles north of the island of Kauai.But with all the new systems in Starship, the SpaceX founder acknowledged the difficulties of achieving all of the flight goals."There's a million ways this rocket could fail," Mr. Musk said. "I could go on for hours."

        A highly anticipated episode capping the fourth season of "Love Is Blind," a buzzy reality dating show, was delayed on Netflix by more than an hour on Sunday night, an embarrassing blunder for a streaming service that has been experimenting with live programming."We are so sorry we're late," Vanessa Lachey, who co-hosts the show with her husband Nick Lachey, said when the show finally began. "We are no longer live, but we are now finally here."It was Netflix's second foray into streaming programs live; last month it streamed Chris Rock's live stand-up comedy special in which he joked about Will Smith slapping him at the Oscars last year. The program's ratings success helped fuel interest in more experimentation with livestreaming.The special - a reunion episode which, in typical reality-show fashion, was designed to rehash the drama of the season and update curious fans on participants' lives - had been scheduled to air at 8 p.m. Eastern on Sunday night. In a tweet just as it was supposed to begin, Netflix promised it would start within 15 minutes. But as the clock ticked past 9 p.m., and the hit drama "Succession" began on H.B.O., the reunion episode had still not started."There is an issue with the livestream," a message from Netflix read.For the live reunion special, Netflix brought on a different company than the one that has produced the last four seasons of the dating show. Sunday's program was produced by Embassy Row, with Brandon Monk and Michael Davies as executive producers. Over the span of three years and four seasons, "Love Is Blind" has become one of Netflix's most popular and well-known franchises, drawing tens of millions of viewers. Netflix's struggles to air the planned reunion episode - which was expected to include appearances from singles who stirred up an unusual amount of drama during the season - drew the attention of viewers who joked about the delays with snipes about the show and its talent, with one user tweeting that Netflix would get DVDs of the reunion to subscribers by mail.Some of Netflix's competitors seized on the chance for schadenfreude. Bravo, a reality TV veteran that airs "The Real Housewives," tweeted: "We would never keep you waiting for a Reunion."Even Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighed in."Someone call Lucia the seamstress to fix this," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, referring to a tailor who helped fix one of the "Love Is Blind" groom's pants just before he was about to get married on the current season of the show. (Part of the reunion's allure involved finding out whether the marriages of the show's contestants, who had agreed to get married without ever having seen each other, had actually stuck.)In a live video from the set of the show, Vanessa Lachey pleaded with fans to keep their attention on Netflix as the show was held in limbo, saying, "Don't turn the channel. Don't stream something else.""Apparently y'all, everybody broke the internet to see this reunion," she said, at one point turning the phone to show the live audience. "So we are ready to roll. We just got to figure this out."The event began for some viewers after 9 p.m. And even after the episode aired, some users experienced technical glitches."To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon … we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned," Netflix tweeted around 9:30 p.m. "We're filming it now and we'll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible. Again, thank you and sorry."

        As three police officers responding to a domestic violence call waited outside a home in Farmington, N.M., one of them asked if they had the right address, moments before an armed man answered the door and was shot to death this month, newly released video footage shows.The call for police assistance had been for another home on the same street.The footage and audio recordings from 911 calls, both of which were released on Friday by the Farmington Police Department, show confusion among police officers and include a desperate plea from a relative of the man who was killed.The video was recorded by body cameras worn by Farmington officers on April 5, the day of the shooting. The three officers were responding to the call for assistance in Farmington, a city about 140 miles from Alburquerque in the rural northwest corner of New Mexico, but they knocked on a door across the street from the intended address.In the video, the number 5305 is visible on an exterior wall of the home, even though the officers were dispatched to 5308 Valley View Avenue.After waiting for a response to their knocks, an officer asks the others if they are at the correct address."Is it 43 or 5308?" another officer asks over police radio. The dispatcher then says the correct address."Don't tell me I'm wrong," the officer says, and then chuckles.About two minutes elapse from the time of the initial knock to when the door is opened. The officers can be seen knocking two other times in the interim.A man later identified as Robert Dotson, 52, opens the front door and a screen door armed with a handgun, which he appears to lift and point toward an officer before the police shoot him. The video has been edited to show a circle around the gun in a slow-motion playback of this moment.The names of the officers involved have not been released and will continue to be withheld "until disclosure would not affect the integrity of the investigation," the Police Department's chief, Steve Hebbe, said in a statement.In the video, moments after Mr. Dotson is shot, a woman who was later identified as his wife can be heard screaming. She then approaches the front door and opens fire at the officers, but she stops upon realizing that they are police officers. Officers shoot back at her, but she is not injured.The footage was taken from the body cameras of all three officers at the scene, none of whom were injured in the encounter. The New Mexico State Police is investigating the shooting.Recordings of four 911 calls related to the original dispatch and the resulting shooting have also been released by the Police Department.One call was from someone who identified herself as a 14-year-old inside 5305 Valley View Avenue, the house in which Mr. Dotson was shot. Through tears, she says her mother told her to call 911 because her father, whom she identified by name later in the call, had been shot.The dispatcher first tells her that the gunshots were from police activity in the area, until she understands that the caller meant that someone at her own home had been shot."Yes, someone shot at my father, definitely," the caller says, adding, "I'm so scared."The caller says she is in a room with her brother and dog."Can you pray with me, please?" she asks the dispatcher.Two of the other 911 calls that were released came from neighbors who were concerned about the gunshots they heard.The fourth audio recording was from the initial domestic violence call, which originated from across the street from where the officers ultimately knocked. The police later investigated the initial domestic call and reported no further complications from that location. The Farmington Police Department will release additional records and files about the encounter after they have been reviewed by legal counsel, Chief Hebbe said."All of us - the men and women of the Farmington Police Department - recognize the severity of this incident," he said in a statement posted on Facebook. "We will do everything we can to ensure a fuller understanding of what took place."

        Two people were dead and four others injured after a shooting at a park in Louisville, Ky., on Saturday night, the police said, the latest instance of gun violence just days after five people were fatally shot at a downtown bank in the city.The shooting at Chickasaw Park occurred around 9 p.m. as hundreds of people gathered to enjoy a warm spring night outside, Deputy Chief Paul Humphrey of the Louisville Police Department said at a news conference on Saturday night.Police were still looking for a gunman as of Saturday night, and said that they were unsure if there was more than one.One person was in critical condition, Chief Humphrey said.Officers were still trying to determine a motive.The shooting came as the city continued to reel from the attack on Monday at Old National Bank, where a 25-year-old man who worked at the bank fatally shot five colleagues and injured eight others, just one recent episode in a country where gun violence has become numbingly common."This has been an unspeakable week of tragedy for our city," Mayor Craig Greenberg of Louisville said at the news conference. He asked for the public's help in identifying those who had disturbed a calm night at the park with gunfire."Let's band together, let's help each other," Mr. Greenberg pleaded. "Let's make this the city we want it to be."

        For more than 30 years, researchers have scoured the depths of Lake Superior for vessels lost to time. Each carries a dramatic story of lives at risk and, many times, lives lost. A stretch of shoreline in Michigan with about 200 known shipwrecks is called "Graveyard of the Great Lakes."Among the greatest of those mysteries has been the disappearance of a fleet belonging to the Edward Hines Lumber Company. On Nov. 18, 1914, the steamboat C.F. Curtis was towing two schooner barges and carrying three million board feet of lumber when a surprise storm sent all three boats to the bottom of Lake Superior. Twenty-eight crew members died across the Curtis and the two schooners, the Selden E. Marvin and the Annie M. Peterson.Now, more than 100 years later, researchers with the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society say part of the mystery of where the boats laid has been solved.The historical society in Michigan's Upper Peninsula announced last week that it had found two of the fleet's three boats during exploratory missions with its research vessel. The Curtis was found in the summer of 2021, some 500 feet below the surface along with eight other shipwrecks, and the Selden E. Marvin was found the next summer, about 600 feet below."When the robot went down, as soon as they hit it, we saw the age on the smokestack, and we knew it was the Hines fleet," said Ric Mixter, a maritime historian and a board member of the historical society's museum. "We could actually read the paint" of the Edward Hines Lumber logo on the Curtis, he said. The two boats were discovered about 25 miles off the shore of Grand Marais, Mich., about four to five miles from each other. The museum hopes the third boat, the Annie M. Peterson, will be found next."It's exciting to find something that changes history a little bit," Mr. Mixter said, "but it's also sad because it is a gravesite for 28 people."Finding the Curtis and the Marvin was equal parts luck and dedication.The Curtis, Marvin and Peterson are just three of about 6,000 vessels believed to be shipwrecked in the Great Lakes. Every summer, the historical society's 50-foot research boat trawls the waters off the coast of Whitefish Point to look for sunken ships, even searching through heavily trafficked active shipping lanes among passing freights as large as 1,000 feet.The Curtis and the Marvin were found near the area known as the "Graveyard of the Great Lakes," largely because of a combination of factors that include shipping congestion and bad weather. The discovery is considered to be among the group's greatest.Because there were no survivors from the three ships and reports (including two brief mentions in The New York Times) about the wrecks varied, researchers have had to piece together a record of what exactly happened on that November day. Historians know that the boats were part of the Hines fleet - the largest lumber fleet on the Great Lakes at the time, with eight steamers and 11 barges in all - and that the three boats were en route to Tonawanda, N.Y., with enough lumber to build 1,200 houses.They also know that other boats in the Hines fleet had experienced bad weather in the days leading up to the sinking of the Curtis, Marvin and Peterson. But the forecast for that day, Mr. Mixter said, did not lead to any concerns.After exploring the two ships, the museum researchers believe the Curtis was towing the Marvin in second position and the Peterson in the third."We see a good portion of her stern is ripped off, and we can tell by the towing bits that she was probably in the middle of the tow," Mr. Mixter said of the Marvin. "It just surprised us to see the damage on the front and the back of that ship."Mr. Mixter said it appeared that the storm "snapped" the tow line between the Curtis and the Marvin."It went down so quickly that nobody had a chance," Mr. Mixter said.Under the lake, Mr. Mixter and a team from the museum were able to see history in granular detail: axes to cut lines if there was a problem, a hand-cranked grinding wheel, a piece of a shirt around rope, tow ropes that clearly snapped."To me, that makes it more of a place where men lived, a place where men worked and tragically a place where men and women have been lost," he said. Unlocking a mystery that "has captivated the lakes, but in many ways faded away since 1914," Mr. Mixter said, "it's just so powerful."Still, there is the mystery of the Peterson to solve, and the historical society's research boat will revisit the area where the Curtis and Marvin were found this summer."I'm hoping that the Peterson is going to be relatively close," Bruce Lynn, the executive director of the museum, said. "We have searched in those areas, but it's just never easy. Often they're in places you're not expecting."The researchers also hope to find relatives of those who were lost at sea. No one has come forward so far, but with renewed attention around the findings, Mr. Lynn said he wouldn't be surprised if that changed."We do search for these wrecks, and when we're fortunate - when we're lucky to find them - it helps us keep the memory alive of the ships, of those sailors, male and female, that were onboard those ships, and keep those stories alive," Mr. Lynn said. "It's a little bit of history that kind of gets hidden. It's under water - nobody thinks about it."

            <h2>Killing on Live TV Renews Alarm About India's Slide Toward Extrajudicial Violence</h2>

        When the police in India's largest state put a notorious mobster-politician's associates in their sights, they unleashed a take-no-prisoners campaign that at times mirrored the brutality of their underworld targets, who had been implicated in a brazen murder.In three separate raids, officers in the state of Uttar Pradesh shot dead four of those associates, including the mobster-politician's son. The deadly "encounters," as such apparent extrajudicial killings are called in India, won praise from the state's leader, Yogi Adityanath, a hard-line Hindu monk who is seen as a potential prime minister.Members of Mr. Adityanath's Hindu nationalist governing party and loyal broadcast media outlets echoed the praise, but also posed a prodding question: Why had the mobster-politician himself, Atiq Ahmed, who was already serving a life sentence and had 100 other cases pending against him, been spared a similarly abrupt and bloody end?That came on Saturday night.Mr. Ahmed, along with his brother, was fatally shot at close range on live television as the two were being taken by the police to the hospital for what had been described as a routine checkup.The three assailants - one of whom extended his arm in front of an officer's face to fire the bullet as the gun touched Mr. Ahmed's head - rained several rounds of bullets into the two men and continued firing after they had crumpled to the ground, before officers in a 17-person security cordon stepped in to tackle them. As they were taken away, the attackers repeatedly shouted "Jai Shri Ram" - hail to the Hindu lord Ram. Afterward, two state ministers described the murders of the two Muslim mobsters as akin to divine justice.The exceptionally public spasm of violence has once again raised alarm about how deeply extrajudicial violence has seeped into the state's governance, a campaign that often carries religious undertones as the governing Bharatiya Janata Party moves to reshape India's secular democracy.Uttar Pradesh, with 240 million residents, makes up one-sixth of India's population, and events there have broad ramifications for the rest of the country.Analysts and rights activists are troubled by many aspects of the situation: an overwhelmed and ineffective judiciary; the public's desensitization to - or even embrace of - violence; and a broadcast media that enables this desensitization by abetting the demonization of the Hindu-first government's perceived adversaries.But what is most troubling is that politicians are learning that violence can yield political dividends in a country deeply polarized along religious lines. In this atmosphere, small-time criminals become heroes of the increasingly militarized Hindu right wing, and leaders like Mr. Adityanath, perpetually dressed in the saffron robe of a monk, find themselves in demand as a protector of Hindu interests."The government isn't interested in trusting its own judiciary or judicial process," said Gilles Verniers, a professor of political science at Ashoka University who has studied Uttar Pradesh politics closely. "It aims to substitute itself to it, recasting the coercive function of the state as an instrument of strongman's governance. The concept of the rule of law gets redefined as a form of coercive power that is arbitrary, partisan and violent. These violent practices are then turned into slogans and electoral props."Mr. Verniers said Mr. Adityanath had built a reputation as a strongman by publicly endorsing and promoting extrajudicial action. According to police officials, more than 180 people have died in "encounters" with the police since Mr. Adityanath took over as chief minister in 2017. He has also sent bulldozers to raze the homes of activists or protesters, endorsed vigilante action against people accused of smuggling cows or having interfaith relationships and quieted dissenting voices with questionable charges under harsh laws."From the beginning of his political career, he has projected himself as a monk-soldier, a vigilante unencumbered by due process or the rule of law. His accession to power in 2017 enabled him to put the state at the service of his violent inclinations," Mr. Verniers said. "There is no doubt that this has earned him more supporters than detractors."The Uttar Pradesh government's media office did not answer a question about the increase in extrajudicial violence. In a statement, the state government confirmed that it had formed a commission of inquiry, headed by a retired justice, to look into the murders and submit its report in two months.Vijay Mishra, Mr. Ahmed's lawyer, said his client had approached India's Supreme Court two weeks before his murder asking for protection, as he feared he was about to be killed. The court told him that the state would protect him."Knowing the risk involved, the police should have taken extra care when it comes to taking him to the hospital from jail. It was their responsibility, and the blame lies on them. The failure to protect his life lies at them," Mr. Mishra said. "When these men fired, the police was so scared that they did not fire back. I want to ask, why do they keep their guns, then? Do they keep these weapons only for scaring the common man?"Mr. Ahmed's notorious career had won him many enemies. While his straddling of politics and crime was not unique in Uttar Pradesh or India, his record appears particularly gruesome.Over four decades firming his grip over a neighborhood of Prayagraj city, formerly known as Allahabad, he amassed more than 100 pending court cases against him, as his lawyer confirmed. Charges included kidnapping, murder and extortion.What gave Mr. Ahmed protection was that he turned his criminal reach into political leverage: As his gang struck fear, he managed to win elections five times as a local assembly member and once as a member of Parliament, using his political influence - as well as the patronage of the parties previously in power in Uttar Pradesh that courted Muslim votes - to stay ahead of the law.That became harder after Mr. Ahmed got to Parliament in 2004. To keep Mr. Ahmed's old local assembly seat within the family, his brother ran for the office - and lost a close race to a man named Raju Pal. Soon after, Mr. Pal was killed, with Mr. Pal's family pointing blame at Mr. Ahmed.As the murder case wound on, Mr. Ahmed's political fortunes waned. He lost his Parliament seat and early this year was convicted of kidnapping the main witness in Mr. Pal's murder case and pressuring him to change his testimony.Then, in February, that witness, Umesh Pal, was shot dead, along with his two police guards. The state promised a firm crackdown; the "encounters" targeting Mr. Ahmed's son and associates soon followed."These mafias will be reduced to dust," Mr. Adityanath declared in the Uttar Pradesh state assembly after the killing of Umesh Pal.Asim Ali, a researcher and political scientist in New Delhi, said violence in Uttar Pradesh increasingly appeared to be "according to political benefit," even as surveys showed a perception among the state's residents that law and order had improved.Mr. Ali said that under the banner of a crackdown on mafia and thuggery that had long menaced the state, Mr. Adityanath appeared to be waging a selective campaign: targeting criminals who proved a problem for his support base, while protecting and empowering others who came from his caste and stronghold. Opposition politicians in Uttar Pradesh have leveled similar accusations against Mr. Adityanath.Mr. Ali said selective treatment of crime in the state was not new; leaders before Mr. Adityanath had used such tactics. But one thing was different."What's changed now is a judiciary which has stopped challenging the government on issues they deem to be of core interests to the ruling party," he said. "Yogi will go as far as he can do without losing his post. And that depends on how weak he perceives the justice system to be."

        Edward Koren, the New Yorker cartoonist who created a fantasy world of toothy, long-nosed, hairy creatures of indeterminate species that articulated the neuroses and banalities of middle-class America for six decades, died on Friday at his home in Brookfield, Vt. He was 87.His wife, Curtis Koren, said the cause was lung cancer.In the gentle, affable kingdom of Koren, the beasts form a polite queue in the woods at a 24-hour banking A.T.M. attached to a tree. They line up to board Noah's Ark, but must pass through security-gate metal detectors. And as smiling cockroaches, they cluster like tourists with a city skyline in the backdrop. One takes a group selfie.With Charles Addams, James Thurber and Saul Steinberg, Mr. Koren was one of the most popular cartoonists in The New Yorker's long love affair with humor. To connoisseurs, his bristling pen-and-ink characters, with or without captions, were instantly recognizable - nonconfrontational humans and a blend of fanged crocodile and antlered reindeer who poked fun at a society preoccupied with fitness fads (bike-riding), electronic gadgets (cellphones) and pop psychology.In a bed for three, a grimacing psychiatrist squeezed between battling spouses takes "couples therapy" notes.Wife to husband amid a debris of smashed furniture: "I think it's wonderful to be so direct with your anger."Two bohemian couples enjoying drinks in a book-lined living room. Looming over them is the elephantine resident beast. "We deal with it by talking about it," the hostess confides.The only child of a New York dentist and a teacher who subscribed to Reader's Digest and National Geographic, Mr. Koren studied art in New York and Paris, struggled for years to create a unique style, and found it hiding in plain sight: the subtle humor of life's contradictions.He published his first New Yorker cartoon in 1962. It depicted a struggling writer in a "Shakespeare" sweatshirt, puzzling over his typewriter.In a career that seemed oblivious to the wars, racial strife and calamities that bloodied the rapiers of more combative cartoonists, Mr. Koren forged his mythic realm of benign beasts and humans with snouts in some 1,100 cartoons for The New Yorker, including dozens of covers, and many more for The Nation, Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, Vogue, Vanity Fair and other publications."My trajectory was a comedy of manners," Mr. Koren said in an interview for this obituary in 2018. "I was drawn to sociology and cultural anthropology. My work was a bit tame, I suppose. I avoided sex. It was political in a different sense. I examined the middle class, and everywhere I looked people were outraged. I did not want to manifest that in my work. I just gravitated toward animals."Elaborating on his anthropomorphic creatures, Mr. Koren said: "Animals are gentle and funny. There is a long tradition in English and French literature, going back to the 19th century, of using animals in humor. For me, it was a framework, a way of getting above the political fray and the passing controversies of the day."Besides his New Yorker work, Mr. Koren published collections of his cartoons, wrote and illustrated children's books and illustrated books by Delia Ephron, George Plimpton and Alan Katz. His cartoons, drawings and prints appeared in shows and galleries across the United States and in England, France and Czechoslovakia. Many became part of museums' permanent collections."Woody Allen's world is Tolstoyan by comparison," Ken Johnson wrote in a Times review of a Koren retrospective at Columbia University in 2010. "Within his comfort zone, though, Mr. Koren can be funny, psychologically acute and philosophically provocative. He has a pitch-perfect feel for gag lines, and with his scribbly draftsmanship has forged one of the most distinctive styles in cartooning."Mr. Koren also drew some frankly commercial, if slyly humorous, cartoons for private clients - vineyards, banks, clothiers, mutual funds, university course catalogs and credit cards.A restaurant waiter in a bow tie takes dinner orders from two seated American Express cards.A holiday reindeer with two toddler-beasties winds up a jeweled music-box at Hermès (Paris)."Out of the unkempt hair styles and ragamuffin dress of the sixties, Mr. Koren has distilled a marvelously ironic comedy of manners," the Times art critic Hilton Kramer wrote in 1975 about an album of New Yorker cartoons. "His hairy creatures, with their smirky animal faces and sloppy social vanities, add something genuinely new to The New Yorker's chronicle of wayward sociability."As the passing years brought new technology, income disparity and the ravages of aging to America's bourgeoisie, Mr. Koren jabbed at myriad targets:A dowser with a Y-shaped divining rod hovers over a desktop computer.A bearded snob on his grand portico greets a grimy plumber: "Ah, Hopkins! Finalmente!"A bathroom mirror speaks a dreaded morning message: "Time has not been kind to you.""I'm the kind of American middle-class folk I like to draw," Mr. Koren told the Knight-Ridder news service in 1982. He found subjects everywhere. Walking in the woods in California, he was passed by a jogger, who called out: "Working on my quads!""There's a cartoon," Mr. Koren said.Mr. Koren usually tried to express something positive in a bad situation. For a New Yorker cover after terrorists killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001, he drew "The Best Offense," a mouselike creature holding up a long nib pen in its right paw and a short sword, point down, in its left.Even his exceptions were gentle:A television talk-show host, looking offstage at a skeleton with a scythe, says, "I see that our time is just about up."In a domestic setting, houseplants, pets, even a hairy goldfish droop and sag as a despondent housewife is informed that her "depression is contagious.""There's an immense sweetness to his personality that radiates through his work," David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, said in an interview on Friday. "This was not an acerbic comic spirit. He had a very different sensibility. There was a real soulfulness to everything he did."While Koren creatures were rarely depicted as threatening to humans, he thrust a jab now and then at the environmental crowd.As two bearlike creatures look hungrily up a tree trunk at a hiking couple cowering in the branches, the man says to his wife, "Tell them how hard we've worked to protect their habitat."Edward Benjamin Koren was born in Manhattan on Dec. 13, 1935, to Harry and Elizabeth (Sorkin) Koren. He was raised in Mount Vernon, N.Y., from which his father commuted to a dental practice in Manhattan. His parents wanted Ed to become a doctor or lawyer, but he began drawing as a teenager and was hooked.After graduating from Horace Mann School in the Bronx in 1953, he attended Columbia College, where he edited The Jester, a student humor magazine. He graduated in 1957 with a bachelor's degree. He studied printmaking, etching and engraving for two years with S.W. Hayter at the prestigious Atelier 17 in Paris, and he earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1964.He soon joined the faculty of Brown University, where he taught the arts until 1977, long after he became famous.In 1961, he married Miriam Siegmeister. They had two children, Nathaniel and Alexandra, and were divorced in 1973. He married Catherine Curtis Ingham in 1982 and had a son, Benjamin, with her.Besides his wife, he is survived by his sons; his daughter, who is known as Sasha Koren; and two grandchildren. Mr. Koren illustrated some 25 books and wrote nine of them, including "Behind the Wheel" (1972), which put readers in the driver's seat of a subway train, a tugboat, an airplane and other conveyances; "Well, THERE's Your Problem" (1980), a joshing of pop psychology nostrums; and "What About Me?" (1989), a collection that featured a beastly Napoleon and a motorcyclist with ram's horns.Mr. Koren, who never retired, worked until the end, his wife said. For The New Yorker's April 17 issue, he drew Moses on a mount overlooking his people and holding up a stone tablet of the Ten Commandments in Roman numerals while proclaiming, "Time for an update!"After vacationing in Vermont for years, Mr. Koren became a full-time resident of Brookfield (population 1,200) in 1982. He joined the volunteer fire department (and was a captain for 30 years) and rode a bicycle nearly every day - he called it "an addiction" - through the changing seasons of a peaceful countryside, far from the cares of cities."When I ride, I often recall lines from Arthur Conan Doyle" (from "Scientific American" 1896), he said in the interview for this obituary, and he recited them: "When the spirits are low, when the day appears dark, when work becomes monotonous, when hope hardly seems worth having, just mount a bicycle and go out for a spin down the road, without thought on anything but the ride you are taking."In "Landscape of Metaphors," Mr. Koren depicted a bearded, balding academic, much like himself, carrying a book through a pastoral setting studded with signs: On a tree was "Metaphor for growth and change." Beside a bird, "Metaphor for lyricism." And on a trail leading to the distant hills, "Metaphor for aspiration."

        Creators of comic books are "famous for being mistreated by publishers," said David Steinberger, a co-founder and the chief executive of DSTLRY, a new company that wants to give writers and artists a greater stake for their creative efforts.Comic book characters can be lucrative intellectual properties, particularly when they make the leap from the printed page to the silver screen, but they primarily benefit the companies that own them. It is a rueful tradition that goes back to the earliest days of the industry. The creators of Superman sold their rights to the Man of Steel for $130 in 1938, the year he debuted, not knowing the global recognition and longevity he would gain.Unlike the creators of Superman, the founding creators of DSTLRY will retain ownership of their characters and concepts, as well as have an equity stake in the company. DSTLRY will produce oversize print comics as well as collectibles, including vinyl figures and posters. The publisher will also offer comics digitally - but only for a limited time. Once the sales window closes, the digital copies will be available only in a virtual marketplace for collectors. The seller will set the price, and a portion of resales will go to the creators."The main drive here is to create a more sustainable and equitable future for creators," said Chip Mosher, the other co-founder of DSTLRY and its chief creative officer. "That's our macro goal - benefiting the creators, and in turn benefiting readers and retailers."Publishing models for comic books are on a spectrum. On one side, the company is king: DC and Marvel Comics reap the primary benefits of the success of flagship characters like Batman and Captain America, which earn millions annually for their publishers.On the other end are publishers like Image Comics, which have a creator-owned model. Image published "The Walking Dead," which was a financial windfall for its creator, Robert Kirkman. In between there are many companies that will take a chance on new properties but usually for a share of the intellectual property rights. Comics creators for AWA, which was established in 2019, received stock in that publisher.The initial comic book creators for DSTLRY are a murderers' row of talent. They include the writers Brian Azzarello, Scott Snyder, James Tynion IV and Ram V and the artists Mirka Andolfo, Elsa Charretier, Lee Garbett, Jock and Jamie McKelvie. (The full list of founding creators is online.)Another creator recruited for the company is Tula Lotay, the founder of the Thought Bubble Comic Art Festival in Yorkshire, a county in northern England. Ms. Lotay, who will draw and write stories for DSTLRY, said the opportunity excited her."We literally co-own the publishing company, which is amazing," she said. "Aside from that, I know Chip and David know my body of work and trust what I'm doing, and so it feels like I have absolute freedom to be as creative as I want to be."The first comic from DSTLRY is "The Devil's Cut," which will have self-contained stories by most of the founding creators. It will be available at comic book stores around the country and in time for Comic-Con International, the pop culture festival planned for July 20-23 in San Diego.The DSTLRY founders are no strangers to working together. In 2007, Mr. Steinberger founded Comixology, a digital comics distributor that Amazon acquired in 2014. Mr. Mosher was the head of content for Comixology."We are really honored by the founding creators' faith in us and their good will and the good will that is out there for doing something like this," Mr. Mosher said.

        A monument has touched down on the Metropolitan Museum's rooftop that a few decades ago I would never have dreamed of finding there: an architectural mothership packed with a cargo of ideas and images encompassing eons of Black American life.The latest and one of the best in the Met's 10-year series of annual Roof Garden commissions, the monument was designed by the young California artist Lauren Halsey. In conceiving it, she has evoked ancient forms found in the Met's Egyptian collection. She has conjured up the Pharaonic funk and empyreal jazz of George Clinton and Sun Ra. And she has streamed in, hot from the street, the urban culture of the South Central Los Angeles neighborhood where she grew up and where she still lives.Finally, she has encapsulated all this richness in a 22-foot-high architectural cube, creating a kind space station/sanctuary, open to the sky and to spectacular views of the city and Central Park.A direct inspiration for the structure would appear to be the museum's famed Temple of Dendur, here reshaped and reduced in size, flanked by four sculptural sphinxes and free-standing columns, its walls covered inside and out with low-relief words and images. But the comparison with an ancient Egyptian model only goes so far.Much of the actual content in Halsey's version is contemporary and personal. The faces of the sphinxes are all portraits of members of her family: her mother, Glenda, her cousin Aujane, her brother Dominic, her life partner, Monique McWilliams. The same with the columns. They're all based on a single fourth-century example on view in the Met's galleries. But Halsey has replaced the images of the Egyptian goddess Hathor on the original with likenesses of South Central artist-friends.The wall inscriptions, hand-incised or cut in low relief, are, for the most part, local and personal too. Where the ancient Egyptians covered the walls of their tombs and shrines with illustrations from the Book of the Dead, Halsey and her team of artists and artisans have created an immersive Book of Everyday Life, one focused on, but by no means restricted to, contemporary Black urban existence, evoked and preserved in words and images carved into hundreds of concrete panels.Halsey, who is 35, has described herself in interviews as a born archivist, committed from the start to collecting and preserving traces of Black popular culture, past and present, following an example set by her history-minded father. After high school she went to a local community college to study architecture, learned Photoshop there, and put her information-gathering, not to say hoarding, impulses to work in minutely detailed digital collages.She continued to produce these, on an ever-expanding scale, as an undergraduate at California College of the Arts. Then, after entering the MFA program at Yale in 2013, she moved in a 3-D direction. During a subsequent residency at the Studio Museum in Harlem, she began carving words and images on gypsum panels, creating a beta version of her first full-scale environment, "The Crenshaw District Hieroglyph Project (Prototype Architecture)," which would appear in the 2018 biennial exhibition "Made in L.A." at the Hammer Museum and attract wide attention.It was with that remarkable piece that the full social and political, as well as the anthropological, intentions of her art became clear. Within a museum context, her walk-in enclosure of panels carved with words and images harvested from daily life in the Crenshaw section of South Central made the piece a valuable repository of cultural history, but a frozen one. Halsey's goal, in fact, was to reconstruct the piece in public, in the neighborhood itself, making it an accessible and interactive community resource and gathering place where anyone could extend and update a collective history by inscribing their own on the walls.For a while it looked like her intentions might be realized. A Kickstarter campaign she launched was a success; the Hammer gave her a best-of-show cash award. Then COVID-19 hit and Halsey put all her time and resources into a collaborative public service effort she called "Summaeverythang," which provided South Central residents with, among other things, free food in a very bad time.Her Met piece is basically an extension, variation and elaboration of the Hammer project, as its title (all in lowercase) suggests: "the eastside of south central los angeles hieroglyph prototype architecture (I)." Again - as always - community is both the source and the subject of Halsey's art, and references to it spread over the more than 700 engraved and sculpted panels that make up the Roof Garden installation.Versions of actual present or past commercial signage, much of it advertising Black-owned businesses, recur (Akkeli Black Man Car Wash, The Braid Shack, Vanessa's Positive Energy), as do names of grass roots civic organizations (Community Youth Center Chill House, Sons of Watts Community Patrol). Terse placard-style statements of protest (Still No Justice, Reparations Now) alternate with lift-up existential exhortations (Keep the Future Alive, Go for Your Funk, Be Who You Is, Together We Can).All of these phrases, in eye-grabbing typefaces and graffiti fonts, intertwine and overlap with images related to fashion, hair styling, nail-styling, churchgoing and utopian architecture, including Italy's Superstudio. References to the liberatory, Black-positive, space-is-the-place movement known as Afrofuturism (flying saucers, floating pyramids, superhero figures, religious symbols, Parliament-Funkadelic props) are prominent in the mix. So are images of items from the Met's collection that caught Halsey's eye during her New York research forays over the past two years. (Her commission was originally scheduled to go up in 2022; Covid-related issues delayed it.)These range from Old Kingdom busts to decorative passages she found on tomb frescos, to a diagrammatic map of Seneca Village, the early-19th-century mostly Black settlement that was originally located a short walk from where the Met is now but was leveled to make way for what became Central Park. (The same map appears on a wallcovering designed by the artist Njideka Akunyili Crosby for the museum's ongoing 2021 installation "Before Yesterday We Could Fly: An Afrofuturist Period Room.")Unsurprisingly, given Halsey's activist practice and rooted loyalties, the Met's roof garden is functioning both as a landing pad and as a launchpad for her commission. In October, when its Met run is done, the installation will be disassembled, packed up, and sent to what might be called its spiritual home: South Central Los Angeles.The plan is to have it reconstructed there in a public space to be - what? A community center that's also a civic monument, that's also a collaborative work of art, that's also a history book of a neighborhood that Halsey has seen vanishing before her eyes under the relentless tide of disenfranchisement and gentrification.It's the same tide that wiped out Seneca Village and that continues to batter and scatter Black and Brown Americans coast to coast. So in this sense the Met commission - organized by the artist in consultation with Sheena Wagstaff, former chair of modern and contemporary art at the Met, and Abraham Thomas, its present curator of modern architecture, design and decorative arts - is very much a New York piece too.And it feels that way, up there on high, with "Cleopatra's Needle," the monumental, 3,000-year-old, Met-owned Egyptian obelisk rising to a point in the park below, and pyramids of all shapes and sizes topping Manhattan buildings everywhere you look, in a city of vivacious, ever under-threat Black and Brown neighborhoods, precious, present and gone.The Met Roof Garden Commission: Lauren Halsey

        Anthony Carrigan was 7 the first time he stepped onstage. And he was terrified. Debilitating stage fright, which he would struggle with for decades, would have led most children to consider alternate careers. Carrigan, a star of the tar-black HBO comedy "Barry," was not most children.Because even that first time, he felt something beyond terror. Diagnosed at 3 with alopecia areata, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the hair follicles, he often found himself stared at, gawked at, even in elementary school."People would look at my alopecia and not really look at me," he said. "That's kind of a weird dehumanizing thing, when someone is looking at a part of you." But onstage, he felt as though he could control how people saw him - which meant he could make sure they saw all of him, or at least all of the character he was playing.They are seeing him now. On "Barry," which returns for its fourth and final season on Sunday, Carrigan, 40, plays the gangster NoHo Hank. Originally meant to die in the pilot, NoHo Hank, powered by Carrigan's sweeping, sunshiny, Emmy-nominated performance, has survived multiple assassination attempts and a presumed panther attack. The character has become a fan favorite, complete with catchphrases ("Hey, man," "super great!") and multiple GIFs of a Season 2 rooftop folk dance.Two days before I met him, a young woman stopped him on the street. "She just wept, like, Beatles-level mania," he said. "She was really lovely, though, very sweet."We were speaking on a Monday afternoon in early April at the Tin Building, an upscale food hall in Lower Manhattan. (He is based in Los Angeles, where "Barry" shoots, but his girlfriend lives nearby.) Alopecia has rendered him bald and without eyebrows or eyelashes, a look that causes a momentary neural jar, until the force of his personality - buoyant, sincere, self-actualized - takes over. Carrigan comes here often. Maybe not often enough.He hadn't made a reservation at the oyster counter, and for a moment it looked as if he wouldn't be seated. I joked that he could pull a "Do you know who I am?" maneuver, and Carrigan had the decency to look appalled."I've never done that!" he said. Once seated, he listened politely as a server described the oysters of the day. He declined the ones from Massachusetts. "I'm from Massachusetts; I know how salty we are," he said, and ordered a dozen from Canada and Maine.After high school in Massachusetts, he studied acting at Carnegie Mellon University. His hair loss was still isolated to patches at that time, and professors often cast him as the longhaired bad boy, a look that determined most of his early roles. That hair and the worry that he would lose it were sources of anxiety. And after landing his first major role, as an amateur detective on the one-season Jerry Bruckheimer series "The Forgotten," his alopecia progressed and he did lose it. At first he covered up, with hairpieces and eyebrow makeup, a must for character continuity. But when the series ended, he put the hairpieces away."I really had nothing to lose at that point," he said as he spooned horseradish onto an oyster. "Because I had no idea what my career was going to look like. I just knew that it was either try it with the way that I looked, or I was going to have to find a new career."So he kept going, without wigs or false lashes, even when his representatives argued for them. He worried that this new appearance would limit the roles he was seen for. It did. But he suspected that this new self-acceptance would free him as an actor. Whatever parts did come his way, he would play the hell out of them.The parts did come. Gone was the bad boy. In its place, he discovered, was the bad guy. He began to play villains, chief among them Victor Zsasz, the psychopath he played for 20 episodes on the Fox superhero series "Gotham." He fretted, sometimes, that he was helping to reinforce a stereotype of bald men as sinister. But it kept him in the Screen Actors Guild. And it netted him an audition for "Barry."NoHo Hank, intended as a minor antagonist, is a member of a Chechen mob. Carrigan had little interest in playing another villain. But the script's violent comedy delighted him. He went back to the formal exercises of his college days. How should Hank move? What animal would he be? A scorpion, he decided, which explains the puffed-out chest, the hands on hips, the scuttling walk."He's a lovable scorpion," Carrigan explained at the oyster counter. "He doesn't want to sting anyone, he doesn't want to hurt anyone. But that's just his nature."He made his audition tape and sent it in. Alec Berg, a co-creator of "Barry," recalled being struck at first by Carrigan's atypical appearance, then by his skill and commitment."For me, I just completely forgot that this is a guy who doesn't have hair," Berg said in a recent phone interview. "He just was that character so thoroughly."When he and the series star and co-creator, Bill Hader, met Carrigan in person, they knew they couldn't kill Hank so quickly. "He was lovely and so imaginative, he really understood the comedy," Hader said, in a separate interview. "I was like, 'I'd like the option that this guy lives.'"Hader described NoHo Hank as a "heavy." But in Carrigan's hands and in the wardrobe department's shrunken polo shirts, he became the lightest heavy imaginable. He's a people pleaser, a charmer. During a Season 2 near-death experience, he tells his underlings, needlessly, in his Chechen-accented English: "I know you look at me and see hard-as-nails criminal, stone-cold killer, ice man. But, uh, this is lie." Hank should have had a career in hospitality, Carrigan said. Hank has said as much himself.Carrigan's command of the role is exhaustive. He often devises new idioms for Hank, as when he substitutes "kid and the poodle" for "kit and caboodle" in a Season 4 episode. And he preapproves each polo shirt."I'm playing the bad guy, but making him likable, making him winning," Carrigan said.In playing both sides of Hank - Hank's cheer, Hank's sting - Carrigan complicates the stereotype of the bald villain, allowing "Barry" to pose knotty questions about good and evil, action and intention. Hank, that likable guy with the juice boxes, has killed an awful lot of people.The complications that Carrigan brings to the part have drawn the attention of other directors. He played a robot in the 2020 comedy "Bill & Ted Face the Music." Paul Weitz cast him as comic relief in the 2021 Kevin Hart film "Fatherhood," attracted, Weitz said, by Carrigan's "baked-in love of performance and love of human eccentricity."So far, no role has rivaled Hank in its complexity or its blood-spattered joy. Carrigan knows this better than anyone. When "Barry" wrapped, just before Thanksgiving, he hung up Hank's costume for the last time and there, in his trailer, said goodbye to him, thanking Hank for the chance to play, to experiment, to make mistakes. Then he stole Hank's watch, a fake Rolex.Berg bet that Carrigan would find other roles. "He's just the nicest, most genuine, friendly, lovely guy," he said. "Part of who he is goes into Hank, but he's not just playing himself, he's really performing.""I don't think it'd be hard for him to step outside of that," Berg added, "play other things."When I met Carrigan at the oyster counter, he was trying to take that step. He had recently returned from a location shoot in Kentucky for a new film. And the director Alex Winter, his co-star in "Bill & Ted," was writing a role for him in another movie. "He has heart and he has physicality," Winter said. "And he has an incredible sense of humor." Is the character a villain? "Everyone's a villain in this thing," Winter said.If Carrigan worries that no subsequent role will be as beloved as NoHo Hank, he worries less than he used to. "When I'm able to curtail my anxiety enough to feel loose and feel free, then I can go in any direction," he said.As he ate his oysters, I noticed a signet ring on his finger, a recent gift from his girlfriend. The ring shows a rabbit. Rabbits are famously fearful animals. But this one, Carrigan pointed out, was running free. "The fear is no longer taking up space," he said.He turned it around, showing an engraving of a trap. Would the rabbit fall into it?Carrigan shook his head. "I think he's already escaped it," he said.

        In New York City, you can find a pretzel within minutes of a craving - in warmed glass cases on corner street carts, all over transit hubs, even in the odd department store. They vary in quality but are often forgettable, something to stave off hunger until a better snack presents itself.But a big pretzel with a soft, dense middle, chewy ends and the perfect combination of tang and salt? That's a little harder to come by. Unless you make it yourself.Compared with a tricky loaf of crusty sourdough, pretzels are not hard to get right, and they can similarly scratch the itch for a savory bread-baking project.Built on bread flour, which has a higher protein content, i.e. more gluten, than all-purpose flour, pretzels' elastic dough provides the foundation for a tender, chewy texture. A little sugar deepens color and flavor, and active dry yeast gives the dough its rise.A long rest in the fridge, which smooths out the dough and develops its flavor, also makes it pliable and not excessively sticky.Arguably the trickiest step is achieving that burnished brown exterior that's salty with a pleasant bitter edge, the thing that makes a pretzel taste like, well, a pretzel. Traditionally, pretzel bakers dip shaped pretzel dough into a caustic sodium hydroxide solution made with lye, a strong alkali. While a lye bath will produce gorgeous results, it requires rubber gloves and extra care - not to mention a special trip to the hardware store. Dipping pretzel dough into a solution made with baking soda is a common workaround. (That said, its effects are milder than the original.)Writing in The Times in 2010, the food scientist Harold McGee suggested doing just that. Baking the soda on a foil-lined baking sheet at a low temperature for an hour creates a stronger alkali that mimics lye more closely than plain baking soda and yields a more pronounced pretzel flavor. It also means that the pretzels need only a quick dip on each side, so you don't have to worry about waterlogged, misshapen dough.After another short rest (the perfect time to heat your oven), the pretzels are ready for a final zhuzh. An egg wash isn't traditional, but it lends an appealing gloss and helps the salt stick nicely. Choose a bright white and crunchy bulky salt, like pretzel or coarse sea. Others will taste fine but won't produce the classic look. Serve the baked pretzels with a grainy mustard, beer cheese or even ranch dressing, but you don't need them. A warm, fresh pretzel couldn't be more satisfying just as is.Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

        This year, the biennial international lighting fair Euroluce, which runs from April 18 through April 23, will check into the fairgrounds at the edge of Milan and dazzle visitors with the latest innovations in this most revolutionary of design categories. New experiments in lighting will also sparkle at concurrent exhibitions like Alcova and in showrooms, courtyards and commandeered palaces in other parts of the Italian city.What follow are some highlights of lighting presentations taking place during Milan Design Week.Stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic, Anna Boch and David Engelhorn, a German couple who are designers, played with a piece of rope. The pleasure they took from its flexibility and beautiful curves led them to develop Mr. Bojangles, a light fixture with an arm that swivels 360 degrees.Mr. Bojangles has an aluminum head that contains an LED bulb and a cloth cord attached to a sturdy steel base. Its whimsy, simplicity and versatility - not to mention its allusion to a famous tap dancer - put it squarely in the tradition of Ingo Maurer, the celebrated German designer who died in 2019 but whose self-named company lives on and is producing the light. A wall version is in the works.Carlo Urbinati, the owner of the Italian lighting house Foscarini, bought Ingo Maurer last year and said he was determined to preserve its DNA. "The company has a long heritage, and its own personality," he said, adding that he intended to maintain a strict division between the businesses.Mr. Bojangles can be seen April 18-23 at Euroluce, Hall 11, Stand 208. It will also be presented on those dates at "Floating Reflection," an exhibition at the Porta Nuova arch, Piazzale Principessa Clotilde; ingo-maurer.com. - ARLENE HIRSTFounded in 2007 by Leon Jakimic, the Czech glass and lighting company Lasvit has danced with a variety of world-class design partners, including David Rockwell. Recently Lasvit's crystal has found its way into custom lighting installations by Rockwell Group for the Equinox Hotel and Peak restaurant in the Hudson Yards development in Manhattan.For their next waltz, Mr. Rockwell and Lasvit have partnered on Constellation, a lighting collection inspired by New York City's night sky - and the Beaux-Arts celestial ceiling mural at Grand Central Terminal. "It's one of my favorite landmarks," said Mr. Rockwell, describing the mural as "the ultimate convener."Those same stars have now aligned in six fixtures the designer is officially launching at the Euroluce lighting show during Milan Design Week. Cassiopeia, shown, is an aluminum fixture that can serve as a chandelier and also as a wall sconce, consisting of five orbs strung into a sort-of "W" shape, like the constellation that sparkles in the northern sky. Similarly, the Polaris floor lamp, Gemini table lamp, Tri-Stars wall sconce and Ursa Minor chandelier take their cues from the heavens."Stars have provided travelers with the original method of wayfinding," Mr. Rockwell said. They have also been known to distract New York City commuters rushing to catch their trains.On view April 18-23 at Euroluce, Hall 15, Stand 212; lasvit.com. - MELISSA FELDMANFrom the time she opened her New York studio in 2006, Lindsey Adelman has produced lighting collections using metal and glass that have graced many an upscale interior. But this year, at Alcova, the itinerant design exhibition space in Milan, Ms. Adelman will unveil LaLAB, which is described as "a new platform for experimental work without agenda." Or, as the designer put it, "It's not systems or collections; I make each piece individually. It's sculptural as opposed to industrial design, which is what I usually do."The new works are grouped into three categories: Cages, Mobiles and Rock Lights. They contain the DNA of Ms. Adelman's industrially produced work, but with more quirks and spontaneity. The Cages, based on her Cherry Bomb Cages, "take the structure a lot further," Ms. Adelman said, describing them as "charged and transparent." For the Mobiles, she takes elements made in advance and arranges them intuitively and playfully, with raw minerals like pyrite, malachite and amber used for their transformative properties. The Rock Lights are unique table lamps with handblown crystal lights draped over different minerals.On view from Monday through April 23 at Viale Molise 62; lindseyadelman.com. - PILAR VILADASDario Buratto, a fashion designer, grew up in Rovigo, Italy, near Murano, and has long been fascinated with the Venetian island's handblown glassware. So it was a small step when he translated his love of Murano chandeliers into lighting that resembles jewelry.Broken Charm is a modular lighting system of blown-glass globes linked by cast-brass chains to create lamps that are like giant illuminated charm bracelets. Produced in Tuscany with Murano glass for Stories of Italy, a Milan-based brand and design studio where Mr. Buratto is the artistic director, the customizable lighting comes with spheres in diameters of 20, 25 and 30 centimeters (about 8, 10 and 12 inches). A version of Broken Charm with six meters (about 20 feet) of chain will be shown from Monday through April 23 at Alcova, Viale Molise 62. storiesofitaly.com. - ARLENE HIRSTThe overriding concern for any lamp, John Pawson said, is that "it has to look good when it's not lit. That's the goal." The English architectural designer's latest effort for Wastberg, a Swedish lighting company, has resulted in two versions of the same design produced in different materials: marble and aluminum. "We first thought of marble for the way it so beautifully transmits light," Mr. Pawson said. "But everyone soon realized that it was very heavy (it weighs over 11 pounds) and very expensive."Searching for a more affordable option, he hit on aluminum. "It has a nice, soft feel to the touch," he said. With its combination of curved and rectilinear lines, the marble lamp has a sculptural presence, whereas the aluminum design's matte extruded exterior and hollow interior feel more high-tech. Mr. Pawson is already using the aluminum version in his office. "Everything is about me," he said, explaining that he cannot design anything without a specific context in mind. Both lights are 7.75 inches tall and 7.75 inches deep and have dimmable six-watt LED bulbs. On view April 18-23 at Euroluce, Hall 13, Stand 121; wastberg.com. - ARLENE HIRSTAs it races to compete in the metaverse, Google might, at first blush, seem like a surprising participant at that grand annual display of analog wonders: Milan Design Week.But the tech giant is coming not with furniture, but to once again share ideas about how technology links up to sensation.In 2018, the Google team mulled the marriage of bytes and everyday life, in a Milan exhibition called "Softwear"; the next year, it contemplated neuroaesthetics and the way art, colors, textures and scents make us feel, in "A Space for Being." Now, the company is exploring water.As Ivy Ross, Google's vice president of hardware design, put it, "Water is very resilient." (This might explain how her team hit on the concept in the Covid pandemic, while contemplating how to survive perilous times.) "It goes around rocks," she said. "It could be strong and fierce, like a waterfall, or it could be soft and rhythmic, and carry someone along."For "Shaped by Water," this year's exhibition, the design team partnered with Lachlan Turczan, a Los Angeles-based artist, to create installations that mix water with light and sound. In one space, pools of water in mirrored sculptures will hum and flow, responding to the movement of people around them. In another, participants will lie back in planetarium-style seating in a dusky room and gaze upward at the ceiling, where reflections of wavy light patterns created by musical vibrations running through liquid dance and spin."Much like cloud-gazing or staring into a fire, this experience is never twice the same," Mr. Turczan said in an email.In the last room, visitors will watch a film that highlights the way water drips, forming "this beautiful bubble," as Ms. Ross described it. The design team used that form as a model for the shape of the Google watch introduced last fall, the first of those products to be engineered fully in-house.Ms. Ross said she was happy to be an outlier among the conventional furnishings and decorative objects of Milan Design Week. "I love giving people a moment to be inspired and to have a different experience and to take pause," she said. In a place full of visual stimuli, she said, "It's like the space between the notes." On view April 18-23 at Garage 21, Via Archimede 26. - MEGAN McCREA

        Chairs are to furniture makers what bread is to bakers: a cultural staple that is harder to make than it looks. At Milan Design Week, which runs from April 18 through April 23, exhibitions of new seating will include a lounge chair called Tortello because of its resemblance to a piece of stuffed pasta; a reissued 44-year-old seat by the Polish-Brazilian designer Jorge Zalszupin, who was inspired by a kangaroo; and an experimental side chair that is built to decay.What follows are a few new riffs on a classic form.To mark the 10th year of collaboration between the London-based design studio Barber Osgerby and the northern Italian furniture brand B&B Italia, Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby have designed a seating system that recalls one of Italy's most beloved dishes. The rounded sides and seemingly pinched center of their new Tortello sofa and armchair (shown) - their first venture into soft furnishing for the brand - give the pieces a striking resemblance to stuffed pasta.The partners denied that they were purposefully aiming at such a literal reference. "The first project we did together was the Tobi-Ishi table, which is very sculptural," Mr. Barber said. Moving forward, they sought a similar design strategy, "starting with a form that's quite graphic and playful."Their goal was to arrive at a shape that could float freely within a space - that could be placed as easily in a living room as in a hotel lobby. "B&B sofas are traditionally quite formal and rectilinear," Mr. Osgerby said. "We thought it'd be fun to do something more organic in shape."The pair developed the silhouette by sending sketches and models to B&B's team in Italy. "It wasn't until it became full scale," Mr. Osgerby said, "that it looked more and more like pasta." On view April 18-23 at B&B Italia's Milan showroom, via Durini, 14; bebitalia.com. - LAURA MAY TODDIn 2013, the Danish-Italian design partnership GamFratesi, working with the Danish furniture company Gubi, created the Beetle, a chair that took loving inspiration from the round, spindly-legged insect. "TEN: Beyond the Beetle" will riff on the now-classic form with unique homages created by 10 international artists and designers. Organized by Marco Sammicheli, the director of the Triennale Design Museum in Milan, the exhibition will be installed in the mosaic-tiled locker room of the city's Bagni Misteriosi (Mysterious Baths), a 1930s complex with swimming pools in the city's Porta Romana neighborhood."No restrictions at all. We wanted them to run wild with it," said Marie Kristine Schmidt, Gubi's chief brand officer, about the contributors. The offbeat offerings incorporate weaving, neon lighting, sound, fashion, ceramics, architecture and sculpture by Arthur Arbesser, Rachaporn Choochuey, Daphne Christoforou, Painé Cuadrelli, Matthew Demarco, Adam Nathaniel Furman, Martin Groch, Frank Maria, Ximena Muñoz and Simon Wick."We aimed to use every scrap of leftover fabric we had at our studio." said Mr. Wick, a 26-year-old Danish fashion designer, about the heap of materials he stacked along with pieces of the deconstructed chair to recreate its form. Mr. Wick worked with pre-existing and recycled apparel just as he does at (di)vision, the sustainable fashion brand he founded with his sister, Nanna Wick. Ultimately, his remade Beetle was built from jackets, plastic bags, tablecloths, deadstock fabrics, foam salvaged from a damaged chair and even the cardboard in which the original Beetle was shipped."TEN: Beyond the Beetle" can be seen April 18-22 at Bagni Misteriosi, Via Carlo Botta 18; gubi.com. - MELISSA FELDMANIn 2019, the designer Luca Nichetto first collaborated with the venerable porcelain manufacturer Ginori 1735, introducing candle holders and diffusers disseminating fragrances inspired by the court of Catherine de' Medici. Now his contributions have billowed into Ginori 1735's first home furnishings collection, called Domus.Included are a swivel armchair and pouf upholstered in Rubelli fabrics, a table with an embossed leather top that doubles as a tray and three lamps produced in collaboration with Barovier & Toso, which has been turning out glass lighting for seven centuries in Mr. Nichetto's birthplace, Murano, near Venice.The LaVenus lounge chair (shown) has a clamshell seat inspired by Botticelli's "Birth of Venus" that is covered in Rubelli's Oriente Italiano jacquard. According to Mr. Nichetto, the gold-plated steel chair legs echo the decorative rim details on porcelain plates.The collection is on display April 18-23 at Ginori 1735, Piazza S. Marco 3; ginori1735.com. - MELISSA FELDMANThis year, the Brazilian company Etel will celebrate the 30th anniversary of its Design Collection and will reintroduce the Kanguru chair, which was designed in 1969 by the architect Jorge Zalszupin. Born in 1922, Mr. Zalszupin emigrated to Brazil from Poland in 1949 and changed his name to Jorge from Jerzy when he became a citizen.He admired Brazil's modernist architecture and started making furniture for the houses he designed. The Kanguru chair, with details like the brass bolt heads where the seat and back are joined, is a classic 20th-century design, but even vintage examples are hard to find.Lissa Carmona, Etel's chief executive and the daughter of Etel Carmona, the company's founder, worked with Mr. Zalszupin (who died in 2020) on a 2014 book about his work and preserved his striking house in São Paulo as a museum. "He had the most avant-garde atelier in Brazil," she said. Mr. Zalszupin thought the Kanguru chair, with its molded wood body and metal frame and accents, "tested the limits of the material," she added. "I need to touch things," the architect said in 2012, "and the details are what give me pleasure." On view Monday through April 23, Etel showroom, Via Pietro Maroncelli 13; etel.design. - PILAR VILADASThe Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos is known for her colorful, large-scale sculptures and installations, including existing objects that she wraps in crocheted or knitted fabric. She first attracted international attention at the 2005 Venice Biennale, with "A Noiva" (The Bride), a chandelier made of 25,000 tampons. But the circumstances that led to the artist's new collaboration with the French furniture company Roche Bobois arose from more mundane circumstances.Ms. Vasconcelos needed a lamp and went to the company's showroom in Lisbon, where she lives. A woman who worked there recognized the artist and expressed the company's desire to work with her."I said I could only do something related to my art," Ms. Vasconcelos recalled. The result was Bombom, a compact sofa in bright, layered colors related to the artist's paintings, with backrests that pivot to allow people to sit in different directions. (They can also be removed.)"The sofa is made like sculpture," Ms. Vasconcelos said, calling it a dynamic object. Bombom also comes in an outdoor version in pastel tones (shown) - "Much more 1950s," she said. On view April 18-23 at Salone del Mobile, Hall 6, Stand C30; roche-bobois.com. - PILAR VILADASEntering Prowl's space at the Alcova exhibition, visitors will encounter a strange sight: a dun-colored plastic stacking chair disassembled, in dirt.It is an unconventional way to introduce a new product, and that is the point. The presentation will spotlight the new Peel chair at the end of its life, as legs, seat and cushion - all made from compostable and biodegradable materials - begin to return to the earth."Someone might say, 'Oh, that's not the sexy part,'" said Lauryn Menard, a founder of the Oakland, Calif., design studio. "But we actually think it is the sexy part."In keeping with their ethos, "to begin with the end," Ms. Menard and her co-founder, Baillie Mishler, conceived the chair with the idea of its being on its last legs. Their work in furniture and fashion taught them that - no matter how beautiful or well-designed a piece - "people's tastes change constantly, people move constantly," Ms. Menard said, so they aimed to "create something that only needs to last as long as we want it to."They partnered with M4 Factory, which specializes in regenerative plastic goods, in a process that involves mixing bast fiber - a hemp byproduct - with a biopolymer to create the injection-molded chair. It is completed with a hemp foam cushion that can be composted in the owner's backyard.In Prowl's exhibition space, set, aptly, in a revivified century-old slaughterhouse, two (fully assembled) Peel chairs will sit atop a hemp-block platform. On the wall will hang a fourth Peel chair in its infancy, flat-packed in paper pulp packaging.The chair is not currently available for purchase, but Prowl is pitching it for licensing. For now, Ms. Mishler said, they hope it helps people get "more comfortable with recognizing that consumption has an end, and this is what it looks like." On view from Monday through April 23 at Viale Molise 62; prowlstud.io. - MEGAN McCREA

        Welcome to The Wordle Review. Be warned: This article contains spoilers for today's puzzle. Solve Wordle first, or scroll at your own risk.This month's featured artist is Simone Noronha. You can read more about her here.★★★★Wordle 664 5/6⬜⬜🟩⬜🟨 JOINT🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜ THICK🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜ THIRD🟩🟩🟩⬜⬜ THIGH🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 THIEFUp until about six months ago, I had zero interest in Wordle. As a writer for one of the most venerated publishing institutions of the English-speaking world (brag!), I was like: I already know many, many words. I don't need to gamify them. Once, I went to South Africa on a reporting trip, and after I introduced myself as an employee of The New York Times, my new friend remarked, "Ah, yes, the Wordle people," as if we don't have 132 Pulitzer Prizes?That all changed when I realized that Wordle doesn't have to be a game. With the right group text, it can be a competition. My Wordle group chat has as many taunts and swears as it does green, yellow and black squares. (GUANO was a crazy day in the chat.) I don't actually know these people - I was added on a whim after a conversation about other games - which makes it all the more fun. Most of the members don't even have names in my phone. All I know, each time I open up the chat, is that somebody with a New Jersey area code got the day's word in three tries, or that a certain musician-record producer-disc jockey-filmmaker-music journalist-actor HATES when he needs four turns to solve, or that somebody is at Disneyland with their kids and we just talk about that for a while.I start my day with the Wordle, because it's the perfect wake-up: exercising your brain while your body is still warm and surrounded by pillows. Some people in the group chat check the other people's letters before they play, searching for clues, which is a skill I only understand in theory. I have no strategies or starting words: I just write whatever comes into my head, or let my fingers do the deciding. It's never neat, but I rarely lose.Four stars, because this was the first time in decades I'd thought to myself, "I before E, except after C," and it was nice to bring some poetry into my day.Today's word is THIEF: a person who steals something, according to Webster's New World Dictionary.This word is moderately challenging because of uncertainty, but a strategy can help.The word contains a common letter pattern with five or six possible answers. Getting the answer in six guesses requires strategic choices at every guess.Simone Noronha is a South Asian illustrator and art director from Dubai who is based in New York. She enjoys weaving narratives and intricate details into her imagery with saturated palettes and the moody lighting that has become her signature. In an interview with Wired, she said, "I like to think of illustrative style as just our natural flaws shining through and doing the best with it."If you solved for a word different from what was featured today, please refresh your page.Join the conversation on social media!
