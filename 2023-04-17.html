        In the spring of 2021, Linda Brandmiller was working at an arena in San Antonio that had been converted into an emergency shelter for migrant children. Thousands of boys were sleeping on cots as the Biden administration grappled with a record number of minors crossing into the United States without their parents.Ms. Brandmiller's job was to help vet sponsors, and she had been trained to look for possible trafficking. In her first week, two cases jumped out: One man told her he was sponsoring three boys to employ them at his construction company. Another, who lived in Florida, was trying to sponsor two children who would have to work off the cost of bringing them north.She immediately contacted supervisors working with the Department of Health and Human Services, the federal agency responsible for these children. "This is urgent," she wrote in an email reviewed by The New York Times.But within days, she noticed that one of the children was set to be released to the man in Florida. She wrote another email, this time asking for a supervisor's "immediate attention" and adding that the government had already sent a 14-year-old boy to the same sponsor.Ms. Brandmiller also emailed the shelter's manager. A few days later, her building access was revoked during her lunch break. She said she was never told why she had been fired.Over the past two years, more than 250,000 migrant children have come alone to the United States. Thousands of children have ended up in punishing jobs across the country - working overnight in slaughterhouses, replacing roofs, operating machinery in factories - all in violation of child labor laws, a recent Times investigation showed. After the article's publication in February, the White House announced policy changes and a crackdown on companies that hire children.But all along, there were signs of the explosive growth of this labor force and warnings that the Biden administration ignored or missed, The Times has found.Again and again, veteran government staffers and outside contractors told the Health and Human Services Department, including in reports that reached Secretary Xavier Becerra, that children appeared to be at risk. The Labor Department put out news releases noting an increase in child labor. Senior White House aides were shown evidence of exploitation, such as clusters of migrant children who had been found working with industrial equipment or caustic chemicals.As the administration scrambled to clear shelters that were strained beyond capacity, children were released with little support to sponsors who expected them to take on grueling, dangerous jobs.In interviews with The Times, officials expressed concern for migrant children but shifted blame for failing to protect them.H.H.S. officials said the department vetted sponsors sufficiently but could not control what happened to children after they were released. Monitoring workplaces, they said, was the job of the Department of Labor.Officials at the Labor Department said inspectors had increased their focus on child labor and shared details about workers with H.H.S., but said it was not a welfare agency.And White House officials said that while the two departments had passed along information about migrant child labor, the reports were not flagged as urgent and did not make clear the scope of the problem. Robyn M. Patterson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that the administration was now increasing scrutiny of employers and reviewing its vetting of sponsors."It's unacceptable that companies are using child labor, and this administration will continue working to strengthen the system to investigate these violations and hold violators accountable," the statement read.But the White House declined to comment on why the administration did not previously react to repeated signs that migrant children were being widely exploited."If I saw it, they could have put it together," said Ms. Brandmiller, who is also an immigration lawyer. "There were so many opportunities to connect those dots that no one ever did." An H.H.S. spokeswoman said the agency had no record of Ms. Brandmiller's concerns. The company that ran the emergency shelter declined to comment.Ms. Brandmiller said she still worried about the 14-year-old boy, Antonio Diaz Mendez.Antonio is living in Florida City, Fla., far from his family in Guatemala. In an interview last summer, he sat on the mildewed porch of a house crowded with other migrant children. He said he was working long shifts in a refrigerated warehouse, packing vegetables for distribution around the country, and had not seen his sponsor in months.He missed his grandmother and sometimes went days without talking to anyone. He wanted to go to school, but felt trapped because he needed to earn money to repay his debts, support himself and help his siblings.No one, he said, had ever come to check on him.Soon after President Biden took office, the growing numbers of migrant children touched off tension between the new administration and longtime government staff members.The president had promised to abide by a 2008 anti-trafficking law that requires the federal government to accept children traveling alone from most countries and allows them to stay in the United States during the yearslong process of applying for legal status.But the law did not anticipate that a pandemic would ravage the economies of Central American countries. Parents in deepening poverty began sending their children to the United States to earn money - part of a phenomenon some immigration advocates call "voluntary family separation."In 2021, as images of children sleeping under foil blankets in overflow centers dominated the news, Susan E. Rice, the White House's head of domestic policy, told staff members she was frustrated with the situation, according to five people who worked with her. Ms. Rice vented in a note she scribbled on a memo detailing the position of advocates, who believed a pandemic-era border closure was compelling parents to send unaccompanied children, sometimes called U.C.s."This is BS," Ms. Rice wrote, according to a copy of the memo reviewed by The Times. "What is leading to 'voluntary' separation is our generosity to UCs!"In a statement, Ms. Patterson, the White House spokeswoman, said that any suggestion that Ms. Rice felt constrained by the demands of the law was false and that she was "proud to be doing the right thing and treating children with dignity and respect."Under the law, the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for vetting sponsors to ensure they will provide for children's well-being and protect them from trafficking or exploitation. But as shelters filled with children, the department began loosening some vetting restrictions and urging case managers to speed the process along.Longtime H.H.S. staff members complained that the changes endangered children. White House aides and administration officials grew exasperated, believing that these workers were clinging to protocols that kept children in shelters when it was better for them to be in a home with an adult."It was maddening," said Vivian Graubard, a White House adviser who worked with Ms. Rice on migrant child issues.At least five Health and Human Services staff members filed complaints and said they were pushed out after raising concerns about child safety.Jallyn Sualog was the most senior career member of the H.H.S. division responsible for unaccompanied migrant children when Mr. Biden took office. She had helped build the program after the passage of the 2008 law and, as a lifelong Democrat, had celebrated Mr. Biden's win.But soon, she said, she began to hear reports that children were being released to adults who had lied about their identities, or who planned to exploit them.She warned her bosses in a 2021 email, "If nothing continues to be done, there will be a catastrophic event." She continued to email about situations she described as "critical" and "putting children at risk."Concerned that no one was listening, Ms. Sualog filed a complaint in the fall of 2021 with the H.H.S. Office of Inspector General, the agency's internal watchdog, and requested whistle-blower protection. She also took the unusual step of speaking with congressional staffers about her worries."I feel like short of protesting in the streets, I did everything I could to warn them," Ms. Sualog said of the administration. "They just didn't want to hear it."In late 2021, she was moved out of her position. She filed a complaint with the federal office responsible for enforcing whistle-blower protection rules, arguing that she had been illegally retaliated against.Last fall, the Office of the Inspector General released a report that discussed Ms. Sualog's case and several demotions and dismissals at the agency that "may have risen to the level of whistle-blower chilling."Ms. Sualog settled with the agency, which agreed to pay her legal fees, and resigned last month.An H.H.S. spokeswoman declined to comment on Ms. Sualog's complaint but said the agency does not retaliate against whistle-blowers. While some staffers disagreed with the administration's approach, the spokeswoman said, significant changes were needed to address the increase in unaccompanied migrant children.Even as veteran employees left, others kept sounding alarms. In January, shortly before the Times investigation was published, a group of workers sent another memo to their H.H.S. bosses saying the system had resulted in unsafe discharges. "We are pulling humanity out of 'Health and Human Services,'" they wrote.Some of the most persistent warnings that children were being funneled into dangerous jobs came from outside the government. H.H.S. releases most children to sponsors without follow-up care, but it hires organizations to provide thousands of the most high-risk children with several months of support services.Last spring, Matt Haygood, senior director of children's services at the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, one of the largest of these organizations, sent an email with the subject line "Trafficking Concerns" to several H.H.S. officials."We have identified some troubling trends in the Chicago metro area," he wrote, including vans picking up children at odd hours, suggesting that they were being driven to factory jobs. Mr. Haygood asked if H.H.S. would consider adding the neighborhood to a watchlist, so that prospective sponsors there would be more closely vetted.An H.H.S. staff member replied that more than 200 children, most of them Guatemalan, had recently been released to the neighborhood and confirmed that many of those cases had been marked as suspicious: Adults were sponsoring multiple children, and minors were working instead of attending school."There are certainly plenty of other concerning trafficking red flags," the staff member wrote. Mr. Haygood expected the agency to add more safeguards for children released to the area, Little Village. Instead, H.H.S. decided they were not needed.In response to The Times, an H.H.S. spokeswoman said the department had already put protections in place for children being released to a few streets in the city and at the time saw expanding those measures as overreach.At a small fast-food restaurant in Little Village one recent afternoon, Guatemalan teenagers played video games on their phones and flirted in Indigenous languages. Several said they worked full time overnight in factories, in violation of child labor laws. Few had enrolled in school.One, Marvin Che, said he came to the United States last year, when he was 16, and had been working 12-hour overnight shifts alongside other migrant children packing products at the manufacturer Pactiv Evergreen, including Hefty plastic party cups. "We came alone, so we have to work hard," Marvin said.A spokeswoman for Pactiv Evergreen said that its company policy prohibited minors from working at manufacturing sites, and that it would make sure its staffing agencies were complying. A representative for Reynolds Consumer Products, which owns the Hefty brand, said Pactiv Evergreen no longer made its party cups.Other social service organizations said they, too, had flagged clusters of suspicious cases, including in Nashville and Dallas."We're waiting for the congressional hearing that's like, 'How did this happen to all these kids?'" Mr. Haygood said.In the last two months, congressional leaders from both parties have questioned why so many migrant children ended up in exploitative jobs, and two oversight hearings are planned in the House on Tuesday.An H.H.S. spokeswoman said the department was aware that some migrant children worked long hours because they are under intense pressure to earn money, but the agency's legal responsibility for children ends once they are released. Still, the department is working to provide a few months of case management to all unaccompanied migrant children, she said.For now, most children released to sponsors have little support aside from an H.H.S. hotline. According to internal documents obtained by The Times, reports of trafficking to that hotline increased by about 1,300 percent over the past five years.In one call last year, a child living in Charlotte, N.C., said his sponsor had found him a job in a restaurant and told him "he needs to work to eat." In another, a child said his sponsor had never enrolled him in school after he was released from an El Paso shelter, and was forcing him to pay for rent and food.The H.H.S. spokeswoman said the agency asks local law enforcement to check on children who might be in danger.Antonio arrived at the border shortly after turning 14, and spent several weeks at a shelter before moving to Florida. A former neighbor had agreed to be his sponsor, but Antonio, who had never spent a night away from his town, had not understood how isolated he would be in the United States.He took jobs with employers willing to hire a child without a work permit - sometimes in landscaping and sometimes in housecleaning. He also enrolled in eighth grade and discovered that he loved biology.He scraped by until the end of the school year, but he needed to earn more money. Instead of continuing to ninth grade, he found the job packing vegetables. He worked numbing shifts that left him chilled each night even though he worked in the heaviest jacket he could afford. A spokeswoman for the company, Jalaram Produce, said it does not hire minors.Antonio had not told anyone back home how much he was struggling. "I don't want them to worry about me," he said. His father became more absent during the pandemic, and he knew his grandmother had no other way to feed his young sisters. He said he might feel less lonely after he turned 16 and qualified to enroll in night school.This was a common hope among migrant children in his neighborhood. A few blocks away, a boy working construction said he felt ashamed about not knowing how to read. He, too, was released in 2021 - at age 12 - and was immediately put to work by a man who had sponsored at least five children. At a day-labor pickup site, a 13-year-old released last year to a man he had never met said he wished he could enroll in middle school and start learning English."People don't know," Antonio said, "but there are a lot of kids here living the same life."Inside the White House, Ms. Rice was at the center of the migrant children crisis. As she pressed to move children out of shelters more quickly, clues began to emerge about what was happening to them once they left.In the summer of 2021, near the height of the crush at the border, H.H.S. managers wrote a memo detailing their worry about increasing reports that children were working alongside their sponsors, a sign of possible labor trafficking. Ms. Rice's team received the memo, and Ms. Rice was also told what it said, according to two people familiar with the conversations.Andrew J. Bates, White House deputy press secretary, disputed that, saying Ms. Rice "did not see the memo and was not made aware of its contents."Around the same time, Ms. Rice's team was told about concerns over a large group of children who had been released to one city in Alabama, according to six current and former staff members. The situation was the subject of frequent updates as H.H.S. sent case managers to the city to check on children, and coordinated with the Labor Department and Homeland Security Investigations to look into whether they were working in poultry plants.One former top White House adviser remembered thinking at the time that the development was worrisome and that it suggested other cases could be going overlooked.A White House spokeswoman denied that senior officials were told about the situation.A few months later, Ms. Rice's staff learned that H.H.S. could not reach a growing number of migrant children just a month after their release, according to a former senior White House official.But the White House largely treated these as discrete events, not as signs of a mounting problem.Tyler Moran, Mr. Biden's senior adviser for migration at the time, said she relied on H.H.S. to tell her how to weigh information, such as the memo from the department's worried managers and the calls to children that were going unanswered. Staff members, she said, had not pointed to a broader child labor crisis. "The White House deferred to the agencies to let us know when things were really a problem," Ms. Moran said.The Department of Labor was sending up signals of its own. In 2022, investigators began uncovering signs of migrant child labor inside industrial workplaces, including several auto part factories in the South. The department put out news releases warning of a rise in child labor violations.Last summer, labor investigators began a major operation at a sanitation company that eventually found that more than 100 mostly Spanish-speaking children were working the overnight shift scouring meatpacking plants around the country. Many of the children had come through the migrant shelter system and been released to sponsors.As investigators found more and more migrant children working for the cleaning company around the country, H.H.S. briefed Ms. Rice's team about the situation regularly over a period of months, according to two people familiar with the conversations.The Labor Department also included details about the sanitation company and auto parts operations in weekly cabinet-level reports. "It was like, 'We have problems here,'" said Martin J. Walsh, the secretary of labor until last month. "We sent reports to the White House, so they knew we were working on this stuff."When the Labor Department updated its public dashboard in December, it showed a 69 percent increase in child labor violations since 2018.A spokeswoman for the Labor Department said that the White House had been aware of the rise in child labor because it was widely public. But Mr. Bates, the White House deputy press secretary, said officials there had not known of the increase in child labor until The Times's February report.Even after Ms. Brandmiller's warnings, the man who had sponsored Antonio, Juan Rivera, was allowed to receive another boy: He said he sponsored a 15-year-old and set him up with a job on a palm tree plantation.Mr. Rivera said in an interview that he had done Antonio a favor by helping him come to the United States. He kept records of his expenses, including the cost of picking up Antonio after he left the shelter, food and clothes when he first arrived, and a twin-size mattress for his shared room. The debt had taken Antonio about a year to pay off.He said he occasionally saw Antonio in the area and assumed that he was working hard and sending money home. "American kids just study, but our kids are poor and have to work," he said. "One has to suffer to earn a little money here."This spring, Antonio's landlord decided the house had become overcrowded. Antonio found a new home, but the rent was twice as high. He changed jobs again, picking up better-paying day labor shifts, and said he no longer hoped to attend night school. Instead, he is trying to save several thousand dollars to hire a lawyer who might help him secure a permit to work legally, in a less grueling job."I need to earn lot of money now," Antonio said. "It's gotten hard, but at least I'm helping."On Sundays, he attends a Spanish-language church with a vibrant youth group. The pastor, Abel Gomez, said Antonio sometimes sits with him after the service and cries about the pressure he feels."What I want most for Antonio is for him to be able to go back to school," Mr. Gomez said. "But I know it's complicated for him because there's no one to support him."Mr. Gomez said he would like to help young congregants like Antonio more - even take them in. But it would be impossible. There are too many in the same situation, and more seem to arrive each week.

        The errand that nearly cost Ralph Yarl his life was of the sort that falls to older brothers everywhere.Ralph, a Black 16-year-old in Kansas City, Mo., had been sent to pick up his younger twin brothers at a friend's house on Thursday evening, his family said. But he mixed up the address, finding himself in front of a house on Northeast 115 Street, instead of Northeast 115th Terrace.The white man who answered the door there shot him in the head and again in the arm after he fell, according to prosecutors. Somehow, Ralph made his way, bleeding, to another nearby house. There, he was told to lie on the ground while someone called for help, his family said.The homeowner who shot him, Andrew D. Lester, 84, was taken into custody by the police for 24 hours, then released without charges on Friday. Over the weekend, anger began to spread in the community. Protesters marched on Mr. Lester's home on Sunday, while the Kansas City police chief, Stacey Graves, acknowledged the public frustration at a news conference. The teenager was released from the hospital on Sunday evening, his father said.As pressure mounted on Monday afternoon, the Police Department said in a statement that it had submitted the case file to the Clay County prosecuting attorney's office. The prosecutor, Zachary Thompson, publicly identified Mr. Lester a few hours later and announced that he had been charged, saying what many already believed: "There was a racial component to the case."Mr. Thompson said Mr. Lester had been charged with assault in the first degree, a class-A felony, and could face life in prison if convicted. He also was charged with armed criminal action, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, Mr. Thompson said.It was not clear if the teenager had knocked on Mr. Lester's door or if he rang the doorbell, but he did not "cross the threshold" into the man's home, Mr. Thompson said. The shots from a .32-caliber handgun were fired through a glass door, the prosecutor said, adding that there was no indication that "any words were exchanged.""We understand how frustrating this has been, but I can assure you that the criminal justice system is working, and will continue to work," Mr. Thompson said.Mr. Lester was not in custody when the charges were announced. Mr. Thompson said at the news conference that a warrant had been issued for his arrest, and that his bail had been set at $200,000."I don't have any information regarding his specific whereabouts," he added, "but it's my understanding law enforcement is aware of the situation and taking all appropriate action."The teenager's father, Paul Yarl, said in a phone interview on Monday evening that his son underwent surgery over the weekend to remove the bullets. He was able to walk out of the hospital on Sunday evening and was expected to make a full recovery, his father said. The first bullet hit his son's forehead on the side of his face, close to the hairline, he said, and the second hit his right arm.Mr. Yarl said that he was relieved when the charges were finally announced.He said that he was confused that Mr. Lester had been "allowed to go home and sleep" but that his main concern was for other Black children. "He could have repeated it with the next kid that looked like Ralph," he said.Mr. Yarl said he learned that his son had been shot in a call from the boy's mother on Friday morning and drove from his home in Indianapolis to Kansas City, where he visited his son and also joined the protest over the weekend."I'm still shocked. He's a good kid," he said, describing his son as an athlete who loves music and video games, and who excels in school. The parents, who are Liberian immigrants, have been divorced since 2017.Mayor Quinton Lucas of Kansas City said in an interview on Monday before the charges were announced that he was "heartbroken and angry about the situation that we find ourselves in.""You've heard about driving while Black," said Mr. Lucas, who is Black. "You've heard about all the other issues that Black people confront in life. Can you not knock on the door while Black? It's almost like you can't exist."Later on Monday, Mr. Lucas said on Twitter that the charges against Mr. Lester were a "first step towards justice for Ralph Yarl." He also said that he had spoken with Ralph's mother and had "shared with her my personal commitment to ensuring we find justice for her son, her family, and all hurting now in our City."The White House said on Monday night that President Biden had spoken by phone to Ralph and that he had "shared his hope for a swift recovery."Before the charges were announced, most of the details about the shooting had come from family members and their lawyers, Ben Crump and S. Lee Merritt, as The Kansas City Star and other local media outlets covered the growing controversy over the release of Mr. Lester, who had not yet been publicly identified."There can be no excuse for the release of this armed and dangerous suspect after admitting to shooting an unarmed, nonthreatening and defenseless teenager that rang his doorbell," Mr. Crump and Mr. Merritt wrote in a joint statement on Sunday.Mr. Crump linked to a fund-raising page started by Ralph's aunt, Faith Spoonmore, who wrote that her nephew, a high school junior, did not have his phone with him when he went to get his brothers."He mistakenly went to the wrong house, one block away from the house where his siblings were," she wrote. She said that her nephew pulled into the driveway and rang the doorbell and that the man who came to the door shot Ralph in the head."My nephew fell to the ground, and the man shot him again," Ms. Spoonmore wrote. "Ralph was then able to get up and run to the neighbor's house, looking for help. Unfortunately, he had to run to three different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up."Chief Graves said on Sunday that the police were called to the scene around 10 p.m. During the news conference, an investigator declined to say whether it was the homeowner who had called 911.The gunman was released after being held for the maximum 24-hour period allowed without charges under state law in a felony investigation, the chief said at the news conference.Chief Graves said that the teenager was expected to give a formal statement to investigators when his injuries allow. She also said that there was a "potential" self-defense or "stand your ground" element that investigators were examining.But the following day, Mayor Lucas said that Missouri's Stand Your Ground law, which was adopted in 2016, should not apply in this case."If Stand Your Ground really lets somebody just shoot somebody that rings a doorbell," he said, "that put the life of every postal worker, every campaigner, every Amazon delivery person at risk in this country."

        A man in upstate New York was charged with murder on Monday in the killing of a woman who was in a car that mistakenly drove into his driveway, officials said.The woman and the three friends she was with never got out of the car on Saturday night, Jeffrey J. Murphy, the Washington County sheriff, said at a news conference. They were turning around after realizing their error when the man, Kevin Monahan, 65, stepped out of his house, in Hebron, N.Y., and fired at least two shots at the car, the sheriff said.One of the bullets struck the woman, Kaylin Gillis, 20, and the group drove about six miles to a nearby town before they got through to 911, Sheriff Murphy said. Emergency services workers responded and performed lifesaving measures on Ms. Gillis, but she was pronounced dead, the sheriff said.Sheriff Murphy described the killing of Ms. Gillis, who lived in Schuylerville, N.Y., about 20 miles from where the shooting happened, as "very sad." He said he knew "for a fact that she comes from a good family" that he knew personally."She was an innocent young girl who was out with friends looking for another friend's house," the sheriff said, adding, "Unfortunately, they drove up this driveway."Mr. Monahan was being held at a local jail and was expected to appear before a county court judge "in the near future," Sheriff Murphy said.Kurt Mausert, a lawyer for Mr. Monahan, said his client owned a contracting business, had lived in Washington County for 30 years and had no previous convictions."My preliminary view of this case is that it was a series of errors which resulted in a tragedy," Mr. Mausert said. "It is too soon to say more than that."The shooting occurred late Saturday in a section of Washington County, about 60 miles northeast of Albany, where many roads are made of dirt and not well lit and where there is little cellphone or internet service, Sheriff Murphy said.Around 9:30 p.m. dispatchers received the 911 call about a possible shooting victim in Salem, N.Y., Sheriff Murphy said. At about the same time, they also received 911 calls about shots being fired on the road where Mr. Monahan lives, Sheriff Murphy said.When officers arrived at the house, the sheriff said, Mr. Monahan was uncommunicative and would not come out. He was taken into custody after about an hour, the sheriff said.Sheriff Murphy declined to comment on what kind of gun Mr. Monahan had used or whether any other weapons had been found at the house. He emphasized that no one had gotten out of the car before Mr. Monahan began firing."There was no reason for Mr. Monahan to feel threatened," Sheriff Murphy said, "especially as it appears the vehicle was leaving."The circumstances surrounding Ms. Gillis's killing echoed those of a shooting in Kansas City, Mo., several days earlier involving a Black teenager who was shot twice by a white homeowner after mistakenly ringing the wrong doorbell.The shooting left the teenager, Ralph Yarl, 16, in critical condition with a gunshot wound in his head, according to his family members and their lawyers. They said he had been on his way to pick up his younger twin brothers at a friend's house but had gone to the wrong house about a block away.After being taken into custody, the homeowner in that shooting was initially released after 24 hours with no charges filed against him, a decision that touched off protests. On Monday, the man, Andrew D. Lester, was charged with first-degree assault.In the Washington County shooting, Mr. Monahan is white, as was Ms. Gillis.

        The errand that nearly cost Ralph Yarl his life was of the sort that falls to older brothers everywhere.Ralph, a Black 16-year-old in Kansas City, Mo., had been sent to pick up his younger twin brothers at a friend's house on Thursday evening, his family said. But he mixed up the address, finding himself in front of a house on Northeast 115 Street, instead of Northeast 115th Terrace.The white man who answered the door there shot him in the head and again in the arm after he fell, according to prosecutors. Somehow, Ralph made his way, bleeding, to another nearby house. There, he was told to lie on the ground while someone called for help, his family said.The homeowner who shot him, Andrew D. Lester, 84, was taken into custody by the police for 24 hours, then released without charges on Friday. Over the weekend, anger began to spread in the community. Protesters marched on Mr. Lester's home on Sunday, while the Kansas City police chief, Stacey Graves, acknowledged the public frustration at a news conference. The teenager was released from the hospital on Sunday evening, his father said.As pressure mounted on Monday afternoon, the Police Department said in a statement that it had submitted the case file to the Clay County prosecuting attorney's office. The prosecutor, Zachary Thompson, publicly identified Mr. Lester a few hours later and announced that he had been charged, saying what many already believed: "There was a racial component to the case."Mr. Thompson said Mr. Lester had been charged with assault in the first degree, a class-A felony, and could face life in prison if convicted. He also was charged with armed criminal action, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, Mr. Thompson said.It was not clear if the teenager had knocked on Mr. Lester's door or if he rang the doorbell, but he did not "cross the threshold" into the man's home, Mr. Thompson said. The shots from a .32-caliber handgun were fired through a glass door, the prosecutor said, adding that there was no indication that "any words were exchanged.""We understand how frustrating this has been, but I can assure you that the criminal justice system is working, and will continue to work," Mr. Thompson said.Mr. Lester was not in custody when the charges were announced. Mr. Thompson said at the news conference that a warrant had been issued for his arrest, and that his bail had been set at $200,000."I don't have any information regarding his specific whereabouts," he added, "but it's my understanding law enforcement is aware of the situation and taking all appropriate action."The teenager's father, Paul Yarl, said in a phone interview on Monday evening that his son underwent surgery over the weekend to remove the bullets. He was able to walk out of the hospital on Sunday evening and was expected to make a full recovery, his father said. The first bullet hit his son's forehead on the side of his face, close to the hairline, he said, and the second hit his right arm.Mr. Yarl said that he was relieved when the charges were finally announced.He said that he was confused that Mr. Lester had been "allowed to go home and sleep" but that his main concern was for other Black children. "He could have repeated it with the next kid that looked like Ralph," he said.Mr. Yarl said he learned that his son had been shot in a call from the boy's mother on Friday morning and drove from his home in Indianapolis to Kansas City, where he visited his son and also joined the protest over the weekend."I'm still shocked. He's a good kid," he said, describing his son as an athlete who loves music and video games, and who excels in school. The parents, who are Liberian immigrants, have been divorced since 2017.Mayor Quinton Lucas of Kansas City said in an interview on Monday before the charges were announced that he was "heartbroken and angry about the situation that we find ourselves in.""You've heard about driving while Black," said Mr. Lucas, who is Black. "You've heard about all the other issues that Black people confront in life. Can you not knock on the door while Black? It's almost like you can't exist."Later on Monday, Mr. Lucas said on Twitter that the charges against Mr. Lester were a "first step towards justice for Ralph Yarl." He also said that he had spoken with Ralph's mother and had "shared with her my personal commitment to ensuring we find justice for her son, her family, and all hurting now in our City."The White House said on Monday night that President Biden had spoken by phone to Ralph and that he had "shared his hope for a swift recovery."Before the charges were announced, most of the details about the shooting had come from family members and their lawyers, Ben Crump and S. Lee Merritt, as The Kansas City Star and other local media outlets covered the growing controversy over the release of Mr. Lester, who had not yet been publicly identified."There can be no excuse for the release of this armed and dangerous suspect after admitting to shooting an unarmed, nonthreatening and defenseless teenager that rang his doorbell," Mr. Crump and Mr. Merritt wrote in a joint statement on Sunday.Mr. Crump linked to a fund-raising page started by Ralph's aunt, Faith Spoonmore, who wrote that her nephew, a high school junior, did not have his phone with him when he went to get his brothers."He mistakenly went to the wrong house, one block away from the house where his siblings were," she wrote. She said that her nephew pulled into the driveway and rang the doorbell and that the man who came to the door shot Ralph in the head."My nephew fell to the ground, and the man shot him again," Ms. Spoonmore wrote. "Ralph was then able to get up and run to the neighbor's house, looking for help. Unfortunately, he had to run to three different homes before someone finally agreed to help him after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up."Chief Graves said on Sunday that the police were called to the scene around 10 p.m. During the news conference, an investigator declined to say whether it was the homeowner who had called 911.The gunman was released after being held for the maximum 24-hour period allowed without charges under state law in a felony investigation, the chief said at the news conference.Chief Graves said that the teenager was expected to give a formal statement to investigators when his injuries allow. She also said that there was a "potential" self-defense or "stand your ground" element that investigators were examining.But the following day, Mayor Lucas said that Missouri's Stand Your Ground law, which was adopted in 2016, should not apply in this case."If Stand Your Ground really lets somebody just shoot somebody that rings a doorbell," he said, "that put the life of every postal worker, every campaigner, every Amazon delivery person at risk in this country."

            <h2>Grand Jury Decides Not to Charge Officers in Shooting Death of Jayland Walker</h2>

        A grand jury in Ohio has decided not to charge eight Akron police officers in the death of Jayland Walker, a 25-year-old Black man who was shot dozens of times by the police after an attempted traffic stop and a chase last summer during which he shot at the police, the state's attorney general said on Monday.Mr. Walker was killed on June 27, 2022, after the Akron police tried to stop his car. When Mr. Walker did not pull over, video released by the police showed, officers chased him, first in vehicles and then on foot. Officers said that they thought Mr. Walker had fired a weapon from his car and that they feared he would fire again, prompting them to shoot him.Attorney General Dave Yost of Ohio said on Monday that Mr. Walker had fired at least one shot at the police from his car. But Mr. Walker was unarmed when the police pursued him on foot and fatally shot him.Eight Akron police officers fired a total of 94 shots at Mr. Walker, and he sustained 46 gunshot wounds, the attorney general's office said. Mr. Yost said that the police did not know that Mr. Walker had left his gun in his car. It was found in his 2005 Buick Century after the shooting.Even before the grand jury's decision, Akron city officials had braced for protests and unrest by covering the windows of the first floor of City Hall with plywood and by fencing off the Summit County Sheriff's Office and the courthouse. The city's public schools announced that they would close on Tuesday. And city officials urged residents to protest peacefully in a designated "demonstration zone" in front of the county courthouse and the Akron Police Department."I would ask that during these times of tension and trauma that you turn toward one another and not on each other," Mayor Daniel Horrigan said at a news conference on Monday.The decision not to charge the Akron police officers came at a time of heightened scrutiny of killings by the police since the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Such cases have led to murder charges in some cases, but others have led to no charges, particularly in cases in which prosecutors have argued that the victims exhibited violence that endangered officers' lives.In Mr. Walker's case, the fact that he had fired a shot most likely bolstered the argument that the officers were justified in their use of deadly force, said Joanna Schwartz, a professor at the U.C.L.A. School of Law."Police officers are very rarely prosecuted, even when they kill people and even when there are significant protests and public coverage and scrutiny of these cases," she said.During the police pursuit of Mr. Walker, the officers believed that he was still armed when he ran from his vehicle, Mr. Yost said.Mr. Walker ignored commands to show his hands and stop and then "reached for his waistband in what several officers described as a cross-draw motion, planted his foot and turned toward the officers while raising his hand," Mr. Yost said at a news conference. "Only then did the officers fire, believing Mr. Walker was firing again at them."Bobby DiCello, a lawyer for Mr. Walker's family, said the family was supporting a call by U.S. Representative Emilia Strong Sykes, a Democrat who represents Akron, for an investigation by the Justice Department into the patterns and practices of the Akron Police Department. He said the family also planned to file a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city and the Police Department."They are distraught, they are saddened, they are sickened by what's happened," Mr. DiCello said in a phone interview on Monday evening. "They are not done with this fight. They feel as though they've lost a battle but certainly not the war for justice."Demetrius Travis Sr., a cousin of Mr. Walker, said in a text message to The Akron Beacon Journal that "disappointment cannot began to express how I feel about this decision," even though he had expected it "based off many actions by the city of Akron, to protect their buildings and block off streets.""Whatever happens because of this decision is not on the Walker family, it is due to a continuing disregard for the lives of Black and Brown people in the United States of America," Mr. Travis wrote.The Akron police chief, Steve Mylett, said at a news conference that the grand jury, after reviewing all the facts, including video footage, had "ultimately determined that our officers did not commit a crime when they encountered Mr. Walker.""In no way does that take away from the tragedy of June 27 and the loss of such a young life," Chief Mylett said. He said that the Police Department would begin an internal investigation to determine whether the officers had violated any department policies. He said that the department would not release the officers' names because of threats made against them.Mr. Horrigan said that he was calling for peace, just as he had when the Police Department released footage of the shooting in July. That footage led to protests over several days throughout Akron, a city of about 200,000 people in northeastern Ohio, south of Cleveland. While the demonstrations were largely peaceful, some resulted in property damage and arrests of demonstrators.Mr. Yost, a Republican, said that his office had "made a point of neutrally presenting all the evidence" to the grand jury, which considered the evidence over more than a week.He said that a judge overseeing the grand jury had instructed the jurors about the law, rather than have those instructions come from the prosecutor as is customary, "to avoid any question about the accuracy of the legal instructions."Only seven of the nine jurors needed to agree that there was probable cause to move forward with charges. Mr. Yost said he was legally prohibited from disclosing the grand jury vote.Speaking on Monday at a news conference at an Akron church with clergy members and civil rights leaders, Ms. Sykes said she would formally request a Justice Department investigation of the Police Department. Pamela Walker, Mr. Walker's mother, had attended the State of the Union address in February, at the invitation of Ms. Sykes."We've seen it too many times," Ms. Sykes said in a statement. "A routine traffic stop ends in death, and a family and community mourn the loss of a son. A brother. A friend. A neighbor. As this country and community reckons with another tragic death, we find ourselves yearning for a justice system that protects us all."

        China's consumers, while wary of big-ticket purchases like cars or apartments, are spending again. Many factories are still running below capacity, but exports have strengthened. Even as construction of new housing is slowing, investment in infrastructure and manufacturing is robust.Despite lingering pockets of economic weakness, China is recovering faster than expected, after the government abruptly lifted stringent "zero Covid" measures in early December.The economy grew 4.5 percent from January through March compared with the same months in 2022, the country's National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. The growth was driven in large part by consumers: Retail sales, a barometer of spending, jumped 10.6 percent in March from a year earlier despite a slump in car sales.The stakes for the rest of the world are high after China experienced one of its worst economic performances in decades last year. For most of the past two decades, China has been the single largest engine of global growth. Despite simmering tensions with the United States, and growing disagreements with Europe, China remains highly interdependent with both of their economies. The International Monetary Fund warned last week that the world faces an increasing risk of a painful slowdown this year as central bankers in the West raise interest rates and banks stumble.Tuesday's report on gross domestic product indicates that China, the world's second-largest economy, is coming back to life."The quarterly growth is beginning to show a hoped-for healthy rebound," said Louise Loo, an economist specializing in China in the Singapore office of Oxford Economics. "A very decent 4.5 percent year-over-year growth pace at this early stage of the reopening also provides the space for authorities to provide support to weaker segments of the economy as needed."China has taken steps to stimulate growth. The government is spending on high-speed rail lines, highways, bridges and other infrastructure, money that helps boost jobs and consumers. The central bank, the People's Bank of China, told commercial banks last month that they could hold slightly smaller reserves against possible losses, freeing them to lend more.Growth in the first months of this year was a considerable improvement from the 2.9 percent pace in the final quarter of last year, when a wave of illness swept across the country in December after pandemic controls were lifted, and is close to the 5 percent target Beijing has set for 2023.So far, spending has been strongest for services like travel and meals. Big hotels in Beijing and Shanghai that turned off elevators last year and often had a single diner in 200-seat restaurants now find themselves with lines of people waiting for a table at breakfast. Most of that activity has been driven by Chinese consumers, as flights into the country have been slow to resume.At the same time, China is facing a widening gap in government budgets, as revenue lags and spending rises. And a slow-motion housing crash remains a considerable drag on the economy. Construction of new homes, offices and stores shrank 5.8 percent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.The local economy in Suzhou, a city on the Yangtze River near Shanghai, shows many of the national trends. Consumers and companies are spending again. But there are considerable differences from neighborhood to neighborhood and even from business to business.At a street market in Suzhou, a butcher named Jiang Yongming stood behind a table covered in slabs of raw pork and complained about the lingering frugality of his neighborhood's residents. People buying meat ask him to chop a large filet into two or three pieces and then buy only one of the pieces, he said.Liu Zhongyou, a catfish and clams vendor at a street market in Suzhou, has had a very different experience. He lost all his sales for a month last year when nearby restaurants were shut because of pandemic restrictions, but now the same eateries have resumed placing big orders."We were losing money during the epidemic - we had no customers," Mr. Liu said. "It's good now."The disparate experiences of two small businesses in the same market are indicative of China's recovery - strong but uneven. Retail sales in China had climbed only 3.5 percent in January and February compared with the same months last year. So the big increase in March represented the first sign of a robust recovery. But the jump is in comparison to an actual decline in March 2022, when Covid cases were rising, leading to the start of Shanghai's two-month lockdown.And some sectors have not recovered at all from the pandemic. Movie theaters have been particularly hard hit: A third of them went under. Box office revenues were down 55 percent last month compared with the same month four years ago, according to Maoyan Entertainment, an online ticketing company in Beijing that tracks the broader industry.Even as China's economy begins revving up again, there is little sign of inflation. Unlike the West, China refrained from sending pandemic checks and coupons to households. So they have limited ability to bid up the prices for goods. Consumer prices were only 0.7 percent higher in March compared to last year, and the prices producers charge their customers for industrial goods actually fell."Inadequate domestic demand remains prominent, and the foundation for economic recovery is not solid yet," said Fu Linghui, an official at the statistical bureau.The incomes of millions of Chinese were severely depressed during the pandemic, and remain weak. Unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds increased in March, to 19.6 percent, from 18.1 percent in February, as many recent college graduates struggle to find white-collar jobs and are wary of working in factories. In a positive sign, unemployment among residents aged 25 to 59 fell to 4.3 percent in March, from 4.8 percent in February.Next to one of Suzhou's iconic canals lined with weeping willows sits a repair shop for tabletop electric motors. The shop has long supplied the many small workshops nearby that make nails and screws for the city's huge industrial sector.The shop's proprietor, who gave his family name, Guo, said that some workshops had failed during the pandemic but that the survivors were back in business. "It is basically much better than before, and the ones that have not closed down have basically recovered," Mr. Guo said.Industrial production - the output of factories, mines and power plants - rose 3.9 percent in March from last year, an improvement from 2.4 percent in January and February. But industrial growth in March was still anemic by China's standards. A sharp slowdown in the car industry was one of the main culprits.Car sales fell 13.4 percent in the first quarter. At the end of December, China let national subsidies expire for electric cars and reinstated a sales tax on gasoline-powered cars that had been suspended during the country's "zero Covid" measures.Overall, exports are recovering, including a 14.8 percent jump in March compared with a year earlier. Factories are catching up on a backlog of orders that had accumulated during "zero Covid" lockdowns.Investment in new apartment buildings, roads, factories and other so-called fixed assets has long been a mainstay of the Chinese economy. Overall fixed-asset investment is growing, including a 5.1 percent increase in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. But investment is not following a pattern welcomed by Beijing.Government spending on new rail lines, roads and other infrastructure rose 8.8 percent in the first quarter compared to the same months last year, the National Bureau of Statistics said. Manufacturing investment was up 7 percent.But after running out of cash over the past two years and defaulting on dozens of overseas bonds, developers of residential real estate are starting very few new housing projects, although housing prices are starting to stabilize.They are focused on finishing the apartment buildings they already started, many of which have been delayed. Stock market investors remain wary of the sector, with one big developer, Sunac China Holdings, seeing its share price fall 59 percent last week when it resumed trading after being suspended for a year.Even people who take delivery of new apartments from developers are often reluctant to spend money on painting and furnishing. At a paint store down the street from Mr. Guo's electric repair shop, customers have disappeared."We have no business now," said the store owner, who gave her family name, Lu. "Nobody comes."

        A cutthroat price war has erupted in the world's largest automobile market.Within a week in March, Volkswagen's Chinese joint venture slashed prices on its ID.3 electric cars by 18 percent. Changan Automobile, one of China's state-owned car manufacturers, offered $3,000 cash rebates, free charging credits and other incentives for its electric vehicles. BYD, the country's biggest E.V. maker, unveiled a second round of markdowns in a month for some of its older models.Amid slumping auto sales, car brands are going to extremes to stay competitive, offering dealership giveaways and deep discounts. Over 40 carmakers have discounted electric and gas-powered vehicles in China this year. The discounts have amounted to several hundred dollars for cheaper models, and tens of thousands of dollars for higher-end offerings."The severity of this cycle of price cuts is something that I've never seen," said Tu Le, a managing director at the Beijing consultancy Sino Auto Insights, who has worked in the automotive industry in China and the United States for 25 years.The price competition has unsettled what was a pillar of strength in the last few years, even as strict pandemic measures shook China's economy and undermined efforts by the ruling Chinese Communist Party to instill confidence.China's car sales fell 13 percent in the first three months of 2023. Sales of traditional automobiles plunged, while growth in electric vehicles slowed, according to the China Passenger Car Association.China's E.V. market has grown rapidly since 2020 - doubling in sales last year - propped up partly by government subsidies. When that program expired in December after 13 years, the competition intensified to attract buyers in an already crowded segment of the market.At the same time, traditional automakers are scrambling to unload inventory of older cars before tougher national emissions standards starting in July make it difficult to sell diesel- and gas-powered vehicles.An already jittery market started to spiral in January when Tesla, the American company that makes electric vehicles in Shanghai, lowered prices in China for the second time in three months. Other manufacturers felt pressure to do the same.This month, Wang Chuanfu, chairman and chief executive of BYD, proposed that the government extend tax exemptions, which reduce the cost of buying electric vehicles, to 2025 instead of allowing them to expire this year. And China's Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce published an article last month calling for a six-month delay in the new emissions standards.The price cuts are not limited to China. Tesla has also lowered prices in the United States and Europe, and its competitors have followed suit. But the intensity of competition reflects the reality that China is not only the biggest market for electric vehicles but also the most competitive.Established domestic carmakers and local start-ups, supported by Beijing's policies encouraging growth of so-called new energy vehicles, flooded the sector, enticed by a once-in-a-generation opportunity to upend the balance of power in the car industry. By one measure, there are around 300 domestic E.V. manufacturers across China.Didi, China's leading ride-hailing service, has developed an electric car with BYD exclusively for its drivers. Xiaomi, a maker of smartphones, has said it plans to debut an electric car next year. Even Evergrande, the beleaguered property developer, was building electric vehicles, although those plans may be in jeopardy because of its debt woes.China is the leading market for electric cars, and more were sold there last year than in the rest of the world. Foreign automakers see an urgent need to gain a foothold in China to develop the know-how and manufacturing scale necessary to compete globally.Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, said the price war "will definitely continue" because of the importance of producing E.V.s in large quantities."In the end, companies with small sales, or poor technology will be easily eliminated," Mr. Cui said.Car companies and dealerships are now pulling out all the stops for customers. Some dealers are offering free vacations or bottles of perfume in exchange for test drives, while some eager sales teams are stalking charging stations in hopes of luring drivers away from the competition.Last month, a promotional poster from a Toyota dealer in the southern city of Shenzhen generated buzz online. It advertised a free gas-powered sedan with the purchase of a bZ4X, the company's electric sport utility vehicle. A woman who answered the phone at the dealership said there was currently no such deal.Kevin Yang, 29, said he visited a Volkswagen dealer in Chengdu last month to look at its electric vehicles. He was struck by a sense of desperation among the salespeople.The salesman stayed well past the end of his workday to plead with him to take a test drive. After Mr. Yang agreed to take the car for a spin, he started receiving daily phone calls from the salesman with offers of lower prices if he was willing to return to the dealership."The rat race is really intense now," Mr. Yang said.There are similarities between the frothy E.V. market in China and the early days of the smartphone boom, when a new technology product attracted scores of upstarts to jostle with established foreign brands.In 2015, there were more than 100 Chinese smartphone manufacturers - a number that has been whittled down significantly to four main domestic brands and Apple. Many non-Chinese brands, such as Samsung Electronics, once a mobile phone leader in China, barely register.Zhu Jiangming, chairman and chief executive of the Chinese E.V. maker Leapmotor, said he saw another similarity. He expects electric car prices to come down faster than traditional cars because, like smartphone makers, E.V. manufacturers will benefit as the prices of components fall and features are improved.It is possible, Mr. Zhu said, that an average to high-end electric vehicle in China could sell for around $7,000 in 10 years. The average price for an electric car in China is already significantly lower than in the rest of the world, around $35,000 compared with $60,000 in Europe and $70,000 in the United States.William Li, chief executive of Nio, one of the top Chinese electric vehicle companies, said he planned to keep Nio out of the price war, which he called "unhealthy and unsustainable." For traditional gas-powered automakers, "cutting prices is their last resort in trying to secure market share," he said in a statement.Some executives fear that consumers will become accustomed to waiting for price reductions. The China Automobile Dealers Association said last month that foot traffic to dealerships had soared after markdowns, but that orders had decreased.Leapmotor and Li Auto sought to assure potential buyers with a guarantee offering to make up the difference if the company lowered prices or offered cash rebates in the next 90 days.Mr. Yang, the car shopper in Chengdu, said he expected prices to go even lower."I heard that there will be more discounts soon," he said. "I'm going to wait a bit."

        China's consumers, while wary of big-ticket purchases like cars or apartments, are spending again. Many factories are still running below capacity, but exports have strengthened. Even as construction of new housing is slowing, investment in infrastructure and manufacturing is robust.Despite lingering pockets of economic weakness, China is recovering faster than expected, after the government abruptly lifted stringent "zero Covid" measures in early December.The economy grew 4.5 percent from January through March compared with the same months in 2022, the country's National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. The growth was driven in large part by consumers: Retail sales, a barometer of spending, jumped 10.6 percent in March from a year earlier despite a slump in car sales.The stakes for the rest of the world are high after China experienced one of its worst economic performances in decades last year. For most of the past two decades, China has been the single largest engine of global growth. Despite simmering tensions with the United States, and growing disagreements with Europe, China remains highly interdependent with both of their economies. The International Monetary Fund warned last week that the world faces an increasing risk of a painful slowdown this year as central bankers in the West raise interest rates and banks stumble.Tuesday's report on gross domestic product indicates that China, the world's second-largest economy, is coming back to life."The quarterly growth is beginning to show a hoped-for healthy rebound," said Louise Loo, an economist specializing in China in the Singapore office of Oxford Economics. "A very decent 4.5 percent year-over-year growth pace at this early stage of the reopening also provides the space for authorities to provide support to weaker segments of the economy as needed."China has taken steps to stimulate growth. The government is spending on high-speed rail lines, highways, bridges and other infrastructure, money that helps boost jobs and consumers. The central bank, the People's Bank of China, told commercial banks last month that they could hold slightly smaller reserves against possible losses, freeing them to lend more.Growth in the first months of this year was a considerable improvement from the 2.9 percent pace in the final quarter of last year, when a wave of illness swept across the country in December after pandemic controls were lifted, and is close to the 5 percent target Beijing has set for 2023.So far, spending has been strongest for services like travel and meals. Big hotels in Beijing and Shanghai that turned off elevators last year and often had a single diner in 200-seat restaurants now find themselves with lines of people waiting for a table at breakfast. Most of that activity has been driven by Chinese consumers, as flights into the country have been slow to resume.At the same time, China is facing a widening gap in government budgets, as revenue lags and spending rises. And a slow-motion housing crash remains a considerable drag on the economy. Construction of new homes, offices and stores shrank 5.8 percent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.The local economy in Suzhou, a city on the Yangtze River near Shanghai, shows many of the national trends. Consumers and companies are spending again. But there are considerable differences from neighborhood to neighborhood and even from business to business.At a street market in Suzhou, a butcher named Jiang Yongming stood behind a table covered in slabs of raw pork and complained about the lingering frugality of his neighborhood's residents. People buying meat ask him to chop a large filet into two or three pieces and then buy only one of the pieces, he said.Liu Zhongyou, a catfish and clams vendor at a street market in Suzhou, has had a very different experience. He lost all his sales for a month last year when nearby restaurants were shut because of pandemic restrictions, but now the same eateries have resumed placing big orders."We were losing money during the epidemic - we had no customers," Mr. Liu said. "It's good now."The disparate experiences of two small businesses in the same market are indicative of China's recovery - strong but uneven. Retail sales in China had climbed only 3.5 percent in January and February compared with the same months last year. So the big increase in March represented the first sign of a robust recovery. But the jump is in comparison to an actual decline in March 2022, when Covid cases were rising, leading to the start of Shanghai's two-month lockdown.And some sectors have not recovered at all from the pandemic. Movie theaters have been particularly hard hit: A third of them went under. Box office revenues were down 55 percent last month compared with the same month four years ago, according to Maoyan Entertainment, an online ticketing company in Beijing that tracks the broader industry.Even as China's economy begins revving up again, there is little sign of inflation. Unlike the West, China refrained from sending pandemic checks and coupons to households. So they have limited ability to bid up the prices for goods. Consumer prices were only 0.7 percent higher in March compared to last year, and the prices producers charge their customers for industrial goods actually fell."Inadequate domestic demand remains prominent, and the foundation for economic recovery is not solid yet," said Fu Linghui, an official at the statistical bureau.The incomes of millions of Chinese were severely depressed during the pandemic, and remain weak. Unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds increased in March, to 19.6 percent, from 18.1 percent in February, as many recent college graduates struggle to find white-collar jobs and are wary of working in factories. In a positive sign, unemployment among residents aged 25 to 59 fell to 4.3 percent in March, from 4.8 percent in February.Next to one of Suzhou's iconic canals lined with weeping willows sits a repair shop for tabletop electric motors. The shop has long supplied the many small workshops nearby that make nails and screws for the city's huge industrial sector.The shop's proprietor, who gave his family name, Guo, said that some workshops had failed during the pandemic but that the survivors were back in business. "It is basically much better than before, and the ones that have not closed down have basically recovered," Mr. Guo said.Industrial production - the output of factories, mines and power plants - rose 3.9 percent in March from last year, an improvement from 2.4 percent in January and February. But industrial growth in March was still anemic by China's standards. A sharp slowdown in the car industry was one of the main culprits.Car sales fell 13.4 percent in the first quarter. At the end of December, China let national subsidies expire for electric cars and reinstated a sales tax on gasoline-powered cars that had been suspended during the country's "zero Covid" measures.Overall, exports are recovering, including a 14.8 percent jump in March compared with a year earlier. Factories are catching up on a backlog of orders that had accumulated during "zero Covid" lockdowns.Investment in new apartment buildings, roads, factories and other so-called fixed assets has long been a mainstay of the Chinese economy. Overall fixed-asset investment is growing, including a 5.1 percent increase in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. But investment is not following a pattern welcomed by Beijing.Government spending on new rail lines, roads and other infrastructure rose 8.8 percent in the first quarter compared to the same months last year, the National Bureau of Statistics said. Manufacturing investment was up 7 percent.But after running out of cash over the past two years and defaulting on dozens of overseas bonds, developers of residential real estate are starting very few new housing projects, although housing prices are starting to stabilize.They are focused on finishing the apartment buildings they already started, many of which have been delayed. Stock market investors remain wary of the sector, with one big developer, Sunac China Holdings, seeing its share price fall 59 percent last week when it resumed trading after being suspended for a year.Even people who take delivery of new apartments from developers are often reluctant to spend money on painting and furnishing. At a paint store down the street from Mr. Guo's electric repair shop, customers have disappeared."We have no business now," said the store owner, who gave her family name, Lu. "Nobody comes."

            <h2>Are Crumbl Cookies the Best or the Worst? It Doesn't Matter.</h2>

        On a sunny Saturday afternoon, dozens of cookie lovers descended on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. They crowded into a small Crumbl storefront, which looked like an Apple store but smelled of Funfetti. They placed their orders on white tablets and snapped photos of their millennial-pink boxes of cookies.Down the street at the original location of Levain Bakery, arguably the most famous cookie purveyor in New York, there was, astonishingly, no sign of the line that normally stretches half a block.Connor Coleman, an artist who lives in the area, said he had tried cookies at many bakeries in New York, but Crumbl is his favorite. "Unless I am making them myself, this is the only cookie place I go to," he said.He bought four cookies, including a Nutter Butter-flavored model. Like most of Crumbl's offerings, it was plump, doughy, intensely sweet and topped with a thick clod of frosting. Each cookie, baked on site, costs between $4 and $5 and can easily serve four people (you can even buy a cookie slicer). And each week brings new roster of flavors, like caramel popcorn, cotton candy, Key lime pie and everything bagel.Not everyone shares Mr. Coleman's enthusiasm."They were so disappointing," said Kiwanna Norwood, a career coach in Little Rock, Ark., who picked up a batch from a store there. "I just couldn't get over them tasting like cookie dough."So are the cookies good or not? When you've got millions of people debating the question, the answer doesn't really matter.Crumbl is the fastest-growing chain of dessert shops in the United States, and the fourth-fastest growing food chain of any sort in the country, according to a 2022 report from Datassential, a food and beverage analytics company. In the last six years, Crumbl has opened more than 750 stores from coast to coast. The company says that last year it sold, on average, nearly a million cookies a day.It's the kind of success that's often traced to social media, but Crumbl is no ordinary internet sensation.The company has manufactured its own hype and turbocharged it by announcing weekly cookie flavors on TikTok as if they were limited-edition sneaker drops, with vaguely sensual, slow-motion videos reminiscent of Burger King commercials. The company has amassed 6.7 million followers on the platform, more than Taco Bell and Starbucks combined."It actually put us on a different trajectory as a company very, very quickly," said Jason McGowan, 43, who founded the company in Logan, Utah, with his cousin Sawyer Hemsley, 30, in 2017.Breanna Brooks is just one of the thousands of people who visit a Crumbl store weekly, and she reviews the rotating flavors on her TikTok account.But whenever she posts a Crumbl review, "a lot of people get really mad," said Ms. Brooks, who lives in Sacramento and works in marketing. They post laments that the cookies are terrible. "I just don't understand," she said. "It is just cookies."Shentel Meadows, a social worker in Richmond, Va., is among those bewildered by all the praise for the cookies. To her, they seem underbaked. "When you eat something raw and it makes your stomach hurt, it has that effect."She felt so disappointed that she complained on Twitter in February: "Just a daily reminder Crumbl cookies aren't good," she wrote.Lauren Gillon, who runs Homegirl Kitchen, a pop-up bakery in Detroit, was tempted by TikTok to try Crumbl. But the cookies tasted artificial, she said. "I just don't get the impression that they are home-baked."Before starting Crumbl, neither Mr. McGowan nor Mr. Hemsley had any baking training. But Mr. McGowan, who had created and sold a web company, figured that those knowledge gaps could be filled through technology and user research."We thought, 'How hard could this be?'" he said.Instead of hiring a chef, the two searched for cookie recipes online, testing their way through dozens of versions and asking people in grocery stores and parking lots for feedback. Mr. McGowan said he invested a few hundred thousand dollars to open the first store in Logan, Utah, and the company still hasn't sought investors.The partners were convinced that TikTok - which, in 2017, was still new in the United States - was the next big social media platform and worth focusing on.After seeing a few reviews of Crumbl cookies on TikTok, the social media team began reposting them on the company's TikTok account with the hashtag #TasteWeekly, and even broadcast the videos in stores. "We doubled down on the content already getting produced," Mr. McGowan said.When the company introduced the rotating flavor menu in 2018, there were suddenly new cookies for people to review each week - and a sense of scarcity. Customers piled onto the #TasteWeekly hashtag, whether they loved or loathed the cookies. The hashtag has 461.5 million views.Crumbl has become a highly sought-after tenant for developers, said Payton Kelly, a senior adviser at SVN, a commercial real estate brokerage in Santa Rosa, Calif. "Anyone who owns a shopping center that doesn't have a Crumbl in a certain radius is reaching out to them right now."Many customers said they judge Crumbl against Insomnia Cookies, a dessert chain known for its late-night cookie delivery. But Seth Berkowitz, the founder and chief executive of Insomnia, doesn't feel threatened by Crumbl's success."A 1,000-calorie cookie," he said. (Last week's menu averaged 766 calories and 62.5 grams of sugar per cookie.) "Hard to imagine eating that daily. It is certainly a unique model."The Crumbl founders, who just opened Crumbl's first international location in Edmonton, Alberta, have heard the criticisms of their cookies. But the sales numbers don't lie, Mr. McGowan said. "We have the world's best cookies."Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

        WASHINGTON - Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Monday proposed a one-year debt ceiling increase paired with a set of spending cuts and policy changes, backing down substantially from earlier demands but making clear that Republicans would not raise the borrowing limit to avert a catastrophic debt default without conditions.In a speech delivered from the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. McCarthy said House Republicans would vote "in the coming weeks" on a measure that would lift the debt ceiling into the next year in exchange for freezing spending at last year's levels while enacting stricter work requirements for social programs and a host of regulatory rollbacks. The plan, which would be dead on arrival in the Senate, would set the stage for yet another fiscal confrontation just as the presidential campaign hits a critical period."I'm not predetermining what has to happen," Mr. McCarthy said in a speech that sought to cast President Biden, who has repeatedly called for a debt limit increase, as the person standing in the way. "I want a responsible, sensible debt ceiling that puts us on an economic path to make America stronger. It works for every American. But that cannot happen if the president continues to ignore the problem.""A no-strings-attached debt limit increase will not pass," he said.The debt limit is expected to be breached as early as July unless Congress acts to raise it.The speech came as Republicans, plagued by internal divisions, toil to agree on a fiscal blueprint to accomplish their demand that any such increase be paired with substantial spending cuts. The outline Mr. McCarthy laid out was significantly narrower than the party's stated objectives earlier this year that included balancing the budget in 10 years, an aspiration that he did not mention in the remarks.It was unclear whether the ideas Mr. McCarthy spoke about on Monday could draw enough backing to pass with his party's slim House majority. Asked in an interview on CNBC minutes after his speech if he had the support of his conference for the plan, Mr. McCarthy stopped short of saying so."I think I have the support of America," he said. "I'll get the party behind it."Mr. McCarthy is likely to struggle to pass any debt limit bill given Democratic opposition to the spending cuts. Some G.O.P. lawmakers routinely vote against raising the limit regardless of which party is in power, and he can afford only a handful of defections.Democrats have said Mr. McCarthy's inability to line up the votes for such a measure has effectively stalled budget discussions, since it has left it unclear what the party's opening bid would be in any negotiation.Mr. McCarthy's decision to offer a potential solution publicly on Wall Street suggested that he was under growing pressure to produce a plan to calm jitters among investors about the grim outlook for a deal to avert a catastrophic default this summer. Yet he shrugged off such concerns on Monday during a question-and-answer session after his speech, saying, "Markets go up and down."The bill Mr. McCarthy says he is planning to put forward would freeze spending at last fiscal year's levels, rescind tens of billions of dollars in unspent pandemic relief funds, enact stricter work requirements on food stamp and Medicaid recipients, expand domestic mining and fossil fuel production, and roll back federal regulations Republicans view as overly burdensome.In a speech that was sprinkled with misleading statements and erroneous assertions, Mr. McCarthy sought to defend Republicans' position on the debt ceiling and portray Mr. Biden's insistence that the nation must not default on its debt as the irresponsible one.Pitching the idea of tying the debt limit increase to new work requirements, Mr. McCarthy said it was time to get Americans "back to work," implying that aid approved early in the Covid-19 pandemic has discouraged adults from working. But Labor Department statistics show that a larger share of Americans aged 25 to 54 - so-called prime-age workers - were in the labor force in March than in February 2020, on the eve of the pandemic.It is also a measure that could rankle lawmakers in Mr. McCarthy's conference facing tough re-election fights in swing districts, some of whom have chafed at calls for narrowing access to safety net programs.Mr. McCarthy also strongly suggested that Mr. Biden had refused to speak with him about raising the debt limit since an initial meeting in February, saying, "I haven't heard from the White House." But his aides and Mr. Biden's have spoken on the matter in the months since, according to White House and congressional officials.Mr. Biden and his aides insist that Congress must raise the debt limit without conditions, but they say the president is open to separate discussions on the federal budget - once Mr. McCarthy produces a formal budget proposal. While they wait for Mr. McCarthy to make an offer, White House officials have criticized the budget cuts Republicans have floated, including the work requirements and proposed limits on domestic spending programs."A speech isn't a plan, but it's clear that extreme MAGA Republicans' wish lists will impose devastating cuts on hardworking families, send manufacturing overseas, take health care and food assistance away from millions of people, and increase energy costs - all while adding trillions to the debt with tax cuts skewed to the superwealthy and corporations," Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said on Monday.At a news conference in Washington, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, was more blunt."If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction," he said, "we are headed to default."

            <h2>Republicans Attack Bragg, Spotlighting Crime Victims in New York</h2>

        One Republican bashed him as "pro-criminal." Another called him a "terrible" prosecutor with a habit of losing cases. A third suggested he was in the pocket of a wealthy Jewish financier frequently demonized by the far right."He should resign and be disbarred," declared Representative Jeff Van Drew, Republican of New Jersey.Two weeks after Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, announced 34 criminal charges against former President Donald J. Trump, House Republicans descended on his home turf on Monday to hold a hearing attacking Mr. Bragg's record on crime, leveling exaggerated and sometimes outright false charges.Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, convened his panel at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building to hear from an array of witnesses who have been outspoken critics of Mr. Bragg for a session that was ostensibly about crime in New York City but whose unmistakable subtext was an effort to tarnish the man who is prosecuting Mr. Trump.The result was a bitterly adversarial hearing that unfolded in a carnival-like atmosphere, drawing angry protesters from the left and the right who hoisted signs and hurled invective that was only slightly more vitriolic than the debate between Democratic and Republican lawmakers.At one point, Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, chastised Republicans for traveling to New York to go after Mr. Bragg, saying they were behaving like "jackbooted thugs."A single elected official most likely has little sway over crime trends in a major metropolitan area, and crime in Manhattan, where Mr. Bragg took office in January 2022, is down from last year by about 2.4 percent - though it remains up significantly from two years ago.Still, Republicans used individual crime victims to try to impeach his record. One by one, the witnesses invited by Republicans told personal horror stories of their encounters with crime in the city, including suffering an antisemitic attack and losing a loved one in a brutal stabbing. The witnesses described New York - where crime has plummeted in recent decades but spiked during the pandemic, as in other cities - as being in a state of decay, and blamed Mr. Bragg's policies."We received no help from his office," said Madeline Brame, the chairwoman of the Victims Rights Reform Council and the mother of a homicide victim who for months has taken issue with the district attorney. "It was a horrific experience."Democrats pushed back against the Republican effort to vilify Mr. Bragg while laboring to show sympathy for the victims."I fear that you are being used for a political purpose, despite your sincerity," said Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, prompting objections from the witnesses.The hearing came a week after Mr. Bragg filed a lawsuit against Mr. Jordan seeking to stop congressional Republicans from interfering in his case against Mr. Trump - the product of a nearly five-year investigation that began under his predecessor - and specifically, to bar them from deposing Mark F. Pomerantz, a lawyer who worked on the inquiry for about a year.On Monday, as the congressional hearing was getting underway, a lawyer for Mr. Jordan filed a response to Mr. Bragg's lawsuit, saying that it represented "an extraordinary and unconstitutional" attempt to have a judge interfere in a congressional inquiry.A lawyer for Mr. Bragg declined to comment on Mr. Jordan's response.The hearing was repeatedly interrupted by protesters and outbursts. At one point, a group loudly attempted entry into the hearing room, chanting, "Let us in!" They held signs that said "Jim Jordan, Insurrectionist," referring to the Ohio Republican's role in planning the efforts in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn the election results, and "34 felonies," a reference to the charges against Mr. Trump.Antisemitism was on vivid display. Outside the Javits building, a man held a sign with the name of the financier George Soros, a Jewish Holocaust survivor, along with the image of a Star of David and dollar signs. Several Republicans inside the hearing room also focused their comments on Mr. Soros, whom they blamed for supporting the campaigns of progressive prosecutors, including Mr. Bragg's."With antisemitic tropes emanating from House Republicans, it's unsurprising, but no less vile, to see the Republicans bringing this antisemitism to New York outside today's stunt hearing in Manhattan," said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the committee.Chaos erupted as the lawmakers left, with anti-Bragg protesters jeering.Inside the hearing room, Democrats and Republicans engaged in a heated dispute over the state of crime in New York and around the nation.Major crime is down slightly in New York this year compared with the same period last year, according to the latest statistics. But, as in cities around the country, New York saw a sharp increase in murders and shootings during the coronavirus pandemic. There was an increase in major crimes last year in New York, but murders, shootings and other crimes have continued to drop.Mr. Bragg has referred to New York as the "safest big city in America" and emphasized that its crime rate is lower than cities in the states of many of his Republican critics, including Columbus, Ohio, just south of Mr. Jordan's district."How do we move the venue so we can have a hearing in a city or state that has a serious crime problem - the state of Ohio," said Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island.Republicans said Mr. Bragg, who announced upon taking office last year that he would not be prosecuting certain misdemeanor crimes - but later revised those policies amid a backlash - had prompted a crime spree."Imagine that," Mr. Jordan said. "You leave criminals on the street, you get more crime."A spokeswoman for Mr. Bragg fired back in a statement: "For outside politicians to now appear in New York City on the taxpayer dime for a political stunt is a slap in the face to the dedicated N.Y.P.D. officers, prosecutors and other public servants who work tirelessly every day with facts and data to keep our home safe."For much of the hearing, Republicans avoided mentioning Mr. Trump's name, seeking to keep the focus on crime in New York.But Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, made the connection as he argued that Mr. Bragg had no business prosecuting Mr. Trump."Was it former President Trump that killed your son?" he asked one victim. "Was it former President Trump that killed your loved one?" he asked another.

        WASHINGTON - Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Monday proposed a one-year debt ceiling increase paired with a set of spending cuts and policy changes, backing down substantially from earlier demands but making clear that Republicans would not raise the borrowing limit to avert a catastrophic debt default without conditions.In a speech delivered from the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. McCarthy said House Republicans would vote "in the coming weeks" on a measure that would lift the debt ceiling into the next year in exchange for freezing spending at last year's levels while enacting stricter work requirements for social programs and a host of regulatory rollbacks. The plan, which would be dead on arrival in the Senate, would set the stage for yet another fiscal confrontation just as the presidential campaign hits a critical period."I'm not predetermining what has to happen," Mr. McCarthy said in a speech that sought to cast President Biden, who has repeatedly called for a debt limit increase, as the person standing in the way. "I want a responsible, sensible debt ceiling that puts us on an economic path to make America stronger. It works for every American. But that cannot happen if the president continues to ignore the problem.""A no-strings-attached debt limit increase will not pass," he said.The debt limit is expected to be breached as early as July unless Congress acts to raise it.The speech came as Republicans, plagued by internal divisions, toil to agree on a fiscal blueprint to accomplish their demand that any such increase be paired with substantial spending cuts. The outline Mr. McCarthy laid out was significantly narrower than the party's stated objectives earlier this year that included balancing the budget in 10 years, an aspiration that he did not mention in the remarks.It was unclear whether the ideas Mr. McCarthy spoke about on Monday could draw enough backing to pass with his party's slim House majority. Asked in an interview on CNBC minutes after his speech if he had the support of his conference for the plan, Mr. McCarthy stopped short of saying so."I think I have the support of America," he said. "I'll get the party behind it."Mr. McCarthy is likely to struggle to pass any debt limit bill given Democratic opposition to the spending cuts. Some G.O.P. lawmakers routinely vote against raising the limit regardless of which party is in power, and he can afford only a handful of defections.Democrats have said Mr. McCarthy's inability to line up the votes for such a measure has effectively stalled budget discussions, since it has left it unclear what the party's opening bid would be in any negotiation.Mr. McCarthy's decision to offer a potential solution publicly on Wall Street suggested that he was under growing pressure to produce a plan to calm jitters among investors about the grim outlook for a deal to avert a catastrophic default this summer. Yet he shrugged off such concerns on Monday during a question-and-answer session after his speech, saying, "Markets go up and down."The bill Mr. McCarthy says he is planning to put forward would freeze spending at last fiscal year's levels, rescind tens of billions of dollars in unspent pandemic relief funds, enact stricter work requirements on food stamp and Medicaid recipients, expand domestic mining and fossil fuel production, and roll back federal regulations Republicans view as overly burdensome.In a speech that was sprinkled with misleading statements and erroneous assertions, Mr. McCarthy sought to defend Republicans' position on the debt ceiling and portray Mr. Biden's insistence that the nation must not default on its debt as the irresponsible one.Pitching the idea of tying the debt limit increase to new work requirements, Mr. McCarthy said it was time to get Americans "back to work," implying that aid approved early in the Covid-19 pandemic has discouraged adults from working. But Labor Department statistics show that a larger share of Americans aged 25 to 54 - so-called prime-age workers - were in the labor force in March than in February 2020, on the eve of the pandemic.It is also a measure that could rankle lawmakers in Mr. McCarthy's conference facing tough re-election fights in swing districts, some of whom have chafed at calls for narrowing access to safety net programs.Mr. McCarthy also strongly suggested that Mr. Biden had refused to speak with him about raising the debt limit since an initial meeting in February, saying, "I haven't heard from the White House." But his aides and Mr. Biden's have spoken on the matter in the months since, according to White House and congressional officials.Mr. Biden and his aides insist that Congress must raise the debt limit without conditions, but they say the president is open to separate discussions on the federal budget - once Mr. McCarthy produces a formal budget proposal. While they wait for Mr. McCarthy to make an offer, White House officials have criticized the budget cuts Republicans have floated, including the work requirements and proposed limits on domestic spending programs."A speech isn't a plan, but it's clear that extreme MAGA Republicans' wish lists will impose devastating cuts on hardworking families, send manufacturing overseas, take health care and food assistance away from millions of people, and increase energy costs - all while adding trillions to the debt with tax cuts skewed to the superwealthy and corporations," Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said on Monday.At a news conference in Washington, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, was more blunt."If Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction," he said, "we are headed to default."

        WASHINGTON - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stood before the Lincoln Memorial in January 2022 and condemned the federal government's coronavirus response by railing against totalitarianism. Jews in Nazi Germany, he suggested, had more freedom than Americans facing vaccination mandates and school, church and business closures in the era of Covid-19."Even in Hitler's Germany, you could cross the Alps to Switzerland," he told a crowd of flag-waving anti-vaccine enthusiasts at a "Defeat the Mandates" rally. "You could hide in an attic like Anne Frank did."Mr. Kennedy later apologized, though it was not the first time he had invoked the Holocaust. Over the past two decades, as he has pursued what he calls "safe vaccine activism," Mr. Kennedy has evolved from an environmental lawyer concerned about mercury poisoning into a crusader for individual liberty - a path that has landed him, a scion of a storied Democratic clan, in the unlikely embrace of the American political right.On Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy plans to formally announce that he is challenging President Biden for the Democratic nomination for president. His vaccine skepticism gives him something in common with another candidate: former President Donald J. Trump, who like Mr. Kennedy has blamed childhood vaccines for autism - a discredited theory that has been repudiated by more than a dozen peer-reviewed scientific studies in multiple countries."Robert F. Kennedy could jump into the Republican primary for president and only DeSantis and Trump, I think, would do better," Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former chief strategist, said recently on his podcast, referring to Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida. Mr. Bannon said Mr. Kennedy had a "massive following" with his audience. "People love this guy," he said.Vaccination is a singular public health success that has saved untold millions of lives. Vaccines have eradicated smallpox, averted millions of deaths from measles and sent naturally occurring polio cases plummeting, from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to six reported cases worldwide in 2021, according to the World Health Organization.Mr. Kennedy has insisted that he is not opposed to vaccines and that his sole interest is in making them safer. "I'm not anti-vaccine, although I'm kind of the poster child for the anti-vax movement," he said during a recent speech at Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian college in Michigan.But through his nonprofit, Children's Health Defense, and his movies, speeches and books - including one that portrays Dr. Anthony S. Fauci as in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry - Mr. Kennedy has used his platform and his family's star power to sow doubts about vaccine safety, spreading misinformation by twisting facts out of context.In 2021, the Center for Countering Digital Hate named him one of its "Disinformation Dozen" - the 12 people whom the organization found to have been responsible for roughly three-quarters of anti-vaccine content on Facebook.Facebook and Instagram have removed the accounts of Children's Health Defense, and Mr. Kennedy has accused them of censorship. He is also suing the Biden administration and Dr. Fauci, who for decades led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, accusing them of pressuring social media companies to censor free speech.Mr. Kennedy declined to be interviewed. In an email message, he said Children's Health Defense had "an extremely robust fact-checking operation." He also pointed to a response by Meta, Facebook's parent company, disputing the "Disinformation Dozen" report. Meta critiqued the study's design, saying that focusing on just 12 people "misses the forest for the trees."Mr. Kennedy, 69, is the third-eldest child of Robert and Ethel Kennedy and a nephew of President John F. Kennedy, who urged Americans to take the Salk polio vaccine and signed the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962 to help states and cities carry out childhood immunization programs.His activism, and now his political aspirations, have been wrenching for his family. Some of his family members have publicly rebuked him. His sister Rory Kennedy told CNN she was backing Mr. Biden, while his sister Kerry Kennedy said in a statement, "I love my brother Bobby, but I do not share or endorse his opinions on many issues."Ahead of his White House bid, Mr. Kennedy is playing up his family history. He lives in California but plans to make his announcement in Boston, a city closely identified with the Kennedys. He recently tweeted a photo of himself in a vintage "Kennedy for President" T-shirt.His name and family reputation have opened doors for him. Dr. Fauci said he had met with Mr. Kennedy several times and had told him "that I believe that his intentions are not evil, but his information is incorrect, and he's misguided and can inadvertently cause significant harm." Dr. Fauci said that when Mr. Kennedy's book about him, titled "The Real Anthony Fauci," came out in 2021, he was "really shocked.""The entire book is such a complete lie," Dr. Fauci said.Mr. Kennedy's messages often have a grain of truth. The Children's Health Defense website, for instance, says "vaccines contain many ingredients, some of which are known to be neurotoxic, carcinogenic and cause autoimmunity." Vaccines do contain preservatives and additives, such as aluminum salts, which have been in use in vaccines for decades. Studies show adverse reactions are rare and typically involve skin allergies.The Children's Health Defense website also states that certain vaccines are not tested against placebos in clinical trials, citing polio, hepatitis and meningitis vaccines as examples. That is misleading. Brand-new vaccines - from polio to measles to Covid-19 - are tested in large clinical trials that include placebo groups. But scientists agree it would be unethical to withhold lifesaving vaccines from study participants. For that reason, when older vaccines are reformulated or updated, studies do not include a placebo group."Vaccine injuries can and do happen," the website declares. That is true as well, but the federal government has an aggressive system to track and detect side effects so they can be addressed.The measles vaccine, for instance, lowers the platelet count in about one in every 25,000 to 30,000 people. That can cause red spots from bleeding under the skin - a problem that is usually "short-lived and self-resolving," said Dr. Paul A. Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. But measles causes that problem in one in 3,000 children - roughly 10 times as many as the vaccine, he said."There are no risk-free choices, just choices to take different risks," said Dr. Offit, who has been a vocal critic of Mr. Kennedy. "You could argue the greatest risk of vaccines is driving to the office to get them."By his own account, Mr. Kennedy was at first a reluctant critic of vaccination. He got involved in 2005, when he was an environmental lawyer suing coal-fired power plants to force them to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic chemicals.The anti-vaccine movement in the United States had been growing amid debate over a rise in cases of autism. In 1998, a British doctor named Andrew Wakefield published a study of 12 children in The Lancet, a prestigious medical journal, that suggested a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism.The article was retracted in 2010, and Mr. Wakefield was later barred from practicing medicine. But in the years after its publication, another theory began to take hold: that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that had been used for decades to prevent bacteria from growing in multiple-dose vials of vaccines, caused autism.The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine never contained thimerosal, but other vaccines given to infants did. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is "no evidence" that the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines cause harm, "except for minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site."But in 1999, after Congress directed the Food and Drug Administration to look at mercury in all products, the American Academy of Pediatrics, federal health agencies and vaccine manufacturers agreed that thimerosal should be removed from childhood vaccines. The decision was made "out of an abundance of caution," said Daniel Salmon, the director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.But the move alarmed parents. As Mr. Kennedy traveled the country giving speeches, he has said, mothers of intellectually disabled children began buttonholing him, pressing him to investigate vaccines."They would say to me in a very respectful but also kind of vaguely scolding way, 'If you're really interested in mercury exposures to children, you need to look at vaccines,'" he told the Hillsdale College audience.In 2005, Rolling Stone and Salon copublished an article by Mr. Kennedy, headlined "Deadly Immunity," that blamed thimerosal in vaccines for fueling the rise in autism. Salon later retracted the article. Mr. Kennedy insisted Salon caved to pressure from government regulators and the pharmaceutical industry.Thimerosal is still used in flu vaccines. In 2015, shortly after Mr. Kennedy published a book about the preservative, he met Eric Gladen, an engineer who believes he was sickened by thimerosal in a tetanus vaccine and who made a film about his experience. The two joined forces. Mr. Gladen's advocacy group, World Mercury Project, was later rebranded as Children's Health Defense."We had two huge tools to raise funds; we had my film, which is about 10 years of research put into 90 minutes, and his book," Mr. Gladen said in an interview, adding, "Between him being a Kennedy, the film and his book, it compelled a lot of people to get involved."The anti-vaccine movement was, at the time, largely the province of the political left. Mr. Kennedy found allies in Hollywood celebrities like Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy. In California, he waged an unsuccessful fight against a bill to eliminate the "personal belief" exemption that allowed parents to opt out of vaccinating their children.Mr. Kennedy has been a vocal opponent of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, a 1986 federal law intended to promote the development of vaccines by shielding manufacturers from lawsuits. In 2003, at the height of the thimerosal controversy, a bipartisan measure to update the law by offering immunity to vaccine additive manufacturers collapsed in Congress.Mr. Kennedy points to such efforts as evidence that lawmakers and federal regulators are conspiring to protect drug companies, which he says lack incentives to focus on safety. During the fight over the California legislation, he invoked those arguments, said Dr. Richard Pan, a former state senator who was an author of the bill and met with Mr. Kennedy at the time."He mainly focused on the F.D.A. being corrupt and in cahoots with the pharmaceutical companies to hide the danger of vaccines," Dr. Pan said.Shortly before Mr. Trump was inaugurated in January 2017, Mr. Kennedy met with him at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Mr. Kennedy said afterward that the president-elect wanted him to lead a "vaccine safety and scientific integrity" commission. He told Science magazine that Mr. Trump had told him he had five friends whose healthy children "developed a suite of deficits" after being vaccinated.The commission never came to pass, but the coronavirus pandemic gave Mr. Kennedy an even bigger platform. As the country grew ever more polarized, with many of Mr. Trump's followers shunning the vaccines and Dr. Fauci becoming a lightning rod, Mr. Kennedy's book about Dr. Fauci became a best seller.Another book by Mr. Kennedy is due out in June, this time focusing on the controversy over the origins of the coronavirus. Titled "The Wuhan Cover-Up," it claims that federal health officials "conspired with the Chinese military" to hide the pandemic's origins - an assertion that appears to conflate experiments by the Chinese military at the Wuhan Institute of Virology with other work there funded by the U.S. government.How much Mr. Kennedy will talk about vaccine safety during his presidential campaign remains unclear. As he did during the rally at the Lincoln Memorial, he used his talk at Hillsdale College to cloak his activism in a broader point - that the government, the press and social media companies are trying to silence him, pushing the United States toward tyranny."The founders, specifically Hamilton, Madison, Adams, said, 'We put freedom of expression in the First Amendment because all the other amendments are dependent on it,'" Mr. Kennedy said. "Because if you give a government the right to silence their opponents, they now have a license for any atrocity."

        Within minutes of riding into Mexico in a rented white minivan last month, Latavia McGee knew that she was lost.She and three of her closest friends - close enough that she called them brothers - had driven from South Carolina to Matamoros in the state of Tamaulipas so that she could get a tummy tuck procedure. It was a journey she had made once before, as part of a wave of American women seeking cosmetic surgery across the border.But this time, she was running late, had no phone service and had veered off course, Ms. McGee recalled in a recent interview. She was struggling to remember where the clinic was supposed to be.Also in the wayward van were Zindell Brown, Shaeed Woodard and Eric Williams, old companions with whom she had grown up in South Carolina. That morning in Mexico, they had been enjoying one another's company, Ms. McGee said, as Mr. Brown, the best Spanish speaker of the four, asked strangers for directions.Then gunshots rang out, and the friends found themselves caught in the crossfire of a Mexican cartel. Mr. Brown 28, and Mr. Woodard, 33, would be killed, and Ms. McGee, 34, and Mr. Williams, 38, would spend four days in captivity, with the dead bodies of their friends beside them.The deadly encounter drew international attention, highlighting the relentless violence that the Mexican government has failed to contain and bringing Republican criticism of the Biden administration for not doing enough to confront cartels across the border. Though the episode is still being investigated, officials have said that they believed the friends were taken by mistake: criminals in Mexico do not usually target Americans. Two days after Ms. McGee and Mr. Williams were released, five bound men were found by the Mexican authorities with a letter, purportedly from a powerful cartel, blaming them for the attack on the Americans.The two survivors are only now beginning to speak publicly about their ordeal, as they continue to cope with the physical and emotional aftermath, which has left Mr. Williams using a wheelchair. In an interview with The New York Times, they described confused captors and gutsy escape attempts before they were released, and they provided more details about what drew them to Mexico.Ms. McGee, who lives in Myrtle Beach, S.C., first had cosmetic surgery in Matamoros about two years ago, she said, and was returning for another procedure. She saw it as a form of self care after having six children. "It wasn't that I was self-conscious, because I always thought I was beautiful," she said. "I wanted to do it, so I saved my money, and I went."While her path across the border was risky, it was also well worn. Experts who track the practice known as medical tourism say that tens of thousands of U.S. residents, most of them women, make the trip every year in search of body-sculpting operations that are cheaper than what they can find at home. Despite the experience of Ms. McGee and her companions, the trend shows no sign of slowing.Cartel violence is distressingly common in Tamaulipas, one of six Mexican states that the State Department warns Americans to avoid because of crime. Even so, women cross the border from Brownsville, Texas, every day to visit clinics in Matamoros offering liposuction and cosmetic procedures known as tummy tucks and Brazilian butt lifts.About 1.2 million Americans traveled to Mexico in 2019 to save money on medical procedures, according to Patients Beyond Borders, a group that offers guidance on health care options abroad. The organization estimates that cosmetic procedures account for about 15 percent of all medical travel from the United States.Jasmine Wilson, 28, of Washington, D.C., went to Mexico last October for body shaping surgery that might have cost her $20,000 domestically, she said. In Mexico, the procedures came to only about one-quarter of that price. In the months since, she has used TikTok to promote the work of her surgeon, whom she found through a Facebook group.Ms. Wilson said larger women often have a hard time obtaining cosmetic procedures in the United States. "A lot of plus-sized women don't even know that they can get plastic surgery," she said, "because they get turned down."Some cosmetic surgeons consider it too risky to operate on patients who have high body mass indexes. But compared with their American counterparts, surgeons in Mexico appear to be more likely to accept those patients, said David G. Vequist IV, founder of the Center for Medical Tourism Research at the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio. Americans with limited access to health care, a category in which people of color are overrepresented, are also more likely to travel for procedures abroad, he said, pointing to a 2016 survey conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.For many patients who undergo butt lifts and related procedures, complications like blood clots or embolisms, which can be fatal, are a bigger concern than the cartels. Even a normal recovery involves bruising, bleeding and painful swelling, which has led to a homegrown system of postoperative recovery houses arising along the border.Roxanne Flores has crossed into Matamoros hundreds of times, she said. She underwent cosmetic surgery in Mexico years ago, and now rents a house in Brownsville where women can pay to stay before and after their operations."I've never, ever been caught up in something" while driving women to Tamaulipas and back, she said, adding that Ms. McGee might have looked out of place in Matamoros because she was in a car with three men.Like many other medical tourists, Ms. McGee prepared for her first surgical trip by sifting through social media platforms where women had recommended doctors and shared photos of their figures before and after procedures.A friend recommended the same doctor that Ms. Wilson had visited. "I was kind of scared," Ms. McGee said this week about her first procedure in Mexico two years ago, because she knew that complications were possible. But she was happy with the results, and decided to go back again for a tummy tuck.After roaming through Matamoros with her friends on the day of her appointment last month, Ms. McGee was ready to head back to Brownsville when a car cut them off.From the back seat of the van, Mr. Brown insisted that he had seen a gun, and he urged his friends to flee, Ms. McGee recalled. Mr. Williams, who was driving, said he did his best to escape as shots rang out, throwing his arm across Ms. McGee in the passenger seat to try to protect her.Someone on the street died in the shooting; news outlets identified her as Areli Pablo Servando, a 33-year old Mexican woman.In the violent, noisy blur, each of the four friends either tried to run from the minivan or was pulled from it, Mr. Williams and Ms. McGee recalled. Then, in a moment that was captured in a bystander's video and shared widely on social media, the four were loaded into the bed of a white pickup truck.As the truck began to pull away from the scene of the shooting, Ms. McGee was the only one of the four who had not suffered a major injury. She and Mr. Williams, who had been shot in the legs but remained conscious, decided that she should try to escape and find help. So she jumped, she said, and ran toward a fence with a gate. But the gate was locked, and the fence was too high to climb over.The assailants forced her back into the truck and beat her, she said. The four Americans were then taken somewhere and accosted by more men with guns, who threatened them and asked them if they were in the drug trade."No," Ms. McGee recalled answering. "We came for surgery."Confusion seemed to creep in as their captors consulted with one another. Some of the assailants told Ms. McGee that she would be released, she said. Still, the threats and beatings continued.The four were taken to a sort of clinic, where Ms. McGee said she saw that both Mr. Brown and Mr. Woodard appeared to be lifeless. "All I could see was their heads and the dreads hanging off the bed," she said. "And all I could do was cry."Mr. Williams - who by then had been stripped - said his injured legs were hastily stitched up. The two survivors and their dead friends' bodies were moved again, to a place where they were surrounded by about a dozen other captives who looked as though they had been badly beaten.The surviving friends languished there for about two days, Ms. McGee said. They prayed together and took turns feeling hopeless, each asking the other to relay loving messages to their spouses and children.Eventually, they were driven to yet another location, where Ms. McGee again tried to escape, they said. She managed to grab the phone of a guard who seemed to be incapacitated, and dialed 911 repeatedly. Each time, she said nothing to the operator, she said, for fear that the cartel might be listening. But she hoped that the police would come if she kept dialing.Her last attempt to flee came after she spotted an empty vehicle outside the place where they were being held. Finding the keys inside, she hauled Mr. Williams into the vehicle with her and hit the accelerator. Rough terrain slowed her down, she said, and then she was spotted; bullets flew again. She was taken back to the room with the bodies.Not long after that, the police arrived. According to the Mexican authorities, Ms. McGee, Mr. Williams and their slain friends were found on the morning of March 7 in a wooden shed surrounded by farmland on the edge of Matamoros. A couple of hours later, the two survivors were in the custody of U.S. officials.The full story of what happened to them in Mexico remains unclear, and many details of their account could not be verified.Since the kidnapping, Mr. Williams has undergone surgery to repair his legs and is unsure when he will be able to walk again. He and Ms. McGee are grieving the loss of their friends, whom they described as supportive and sweet."I'll never be the same," Ms. McGee said. "I'll never be OK."Sometimes, Ms. McGee's phone still brings her notifications from the cosmetic surgery groups she joined years ago on social media, where women continue to post about their plans for procedures in Mexico.

        NAIROBI, Kenya - As two rival generals, each with his own army, grappled for power in Sudan on Monday, even hospitals trying to tend to the swelling numbers of wounded were no longer havens.At one overwhelmed medical center, the morning began with shelling. Then, members of a paramilitary force barged inside, ordered newborns and other patients to be evacuated, and began taking up positions, one doctor said."The hospital turned into a battlefield," said the doctor, Musab Khojali, an emergency room physician at the Police Hospital in Burri, northeast of the capital, Khartoum.Many other hospitals were also reported to have come under attack on Monday, the third day of fighting in Sudan.The death toll has risen to at least 180, with about 1,800 others injured.The two generals, who together seized power in a coup in 2021, have now turned against each other - rebuffing all attempts by mediators who for months had been pressing them to unite their fighting forces under one umbrella, relinquish power and allow a transition to civilian rule.Amid growing reports of random violence and looting, concerns grew that the fighting might embroil other nations in the region, including Egypt, which has troops in the country, as well as Chad, Ethiopia and Libya. Russia has also been trying to make inroads in Sudan, and members of the Kremlin-affiliated Wagner private military company are posted there.Leaders from around the world called for a cease-fire, but it was not clear who, if anyone, was in control of Sudan, Africa's third-largest country, by area.In Khartoum, where many have lost power and water, residents watched warplanes and military helicopters circling ominously, and homes shuddered with the sound of shelling. Those few who dared venture out from their homes found the streets dangerous and desolate."Everyone is afraid," said Ahmed Abuhurira, a 28-year-old mechanical engineer who went out to try to charge his cellphone. "You can see it in their eyes. People are panicking."The fighting began on Saturday, when forces loyal to Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, the head of the paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces, began clashing with forces loyal to the Sudanese army chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.Only the army has aircraft, and on Monday, General Hamdan accused his rival of "bombing civilians from the air." The Sudanese Army said in a statement that it was "operating within the rules of conflict and international humanitarian law."The turn of events has worsened a crisis in a nation where one-third of its 45 million people were already in need of food aid. Now, the violence has forced aid groups to suspend operations. The United Nations World Food Program says three of its workers were killed.And on Monday, the U.N. envoy to Sudan, Volker Perthes, said gunmen had been looting and burning warehouses holding critically needed aid, as well guesthouses and offices of agencies like the World Food Program and UNICEF.António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, said he had spoken with both warring generals and expressed deep concern. "The humanitarian situation in Sudan was already precarious and is now catastrophic," he said.The American secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, called for an immediate cease-fire, and spoke separately with General Hamdan and General al-Burhan to underscore "the urgency of reaching a cease-fire," Vedant Patel, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement."The secretary expressed his grave concern about the death and injury of so many Sudanese civilians due to the sustained, indiscriminate fighting, and stressed the responsibility of the two generals to ensure the safety and well-being of civilians, diplomatic personnel, and humanitarian workers," Mr. Patel said.General Hamdan said on Twitter that he was "honored to have a vital conversation" with Mr. Blinken and had discussed their "shared dedication to freedom, justice and democracy for our people."For now, however, even the much more modest goal of a cease-fire appears elusive.Mr. Perthes said that he was talking to the leaders of both military factions daily, and that they had made it clear that they had no intention of ending the fighting. They are, however, receptive to the idea of a "pause" to allow humanitarian access, he said.Although the toll on civilians has been most evident in Khartoum, aid workers say they are also concerned by the situation outside the capital, and especially in the western Darfur region.Save the Children, an aid organization, said on Monday that looters had stolen medical supplies for children, as well as a refrigerator, laptops and cars in a raid on one of its offices in Darfur. The group's Sudan director, Arshad Malik, called on the combatants to safeguard humanitarian services."For the past three days," he said in a statement, "people across Sudan have been gripped by fear, not knowing if it is safe to leave their homes, and now having to make the choice between facing that fear and starving to death."Cyrus Paye, a coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in North Darfur, said in a statement that most of the wounded there were "civilians who were caught in the crossfire - among them are many children."He painted a dire picture of the conditions for medical workers."The hospital is rapidly running out of medical supplies to treat survivors," Mr. Paye said. "It is running out of medicines and blood. There has also been a power outage in the city since the beginning of the fighting, and fuel supplies for the hospital generator are also running low."The Central Committee for Sudanese Doctors said that more than a dozen hospitals had been forced to close. "Hospitals in Sudan are under bombardment," the group said.American diplomats are sheltering in place, and a White House spokesman said that "all U.S. government personnel are accounted for."But Western officials reported that the European Union ambassador to Sudan, Aidan O'Hara, had been assaulted at his home in Khartoum after armed men broke in, threatened him at gunpoint and stole money.The assailants were members of the Rapid Support Forces paramilitaries, identified by their uniforms, several officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for security reasons."This constitutes a gross violation of the Vienna Convention," Josep Borrell Fontelles, the top diplomat for the bloc, said on Twitter. "Security of diplomatic premises and staff is a primary responsibility of Sudanese authorities and an obligation under international law."The U.N. spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said that gunmen were forcing staff members out of their apartments in Khartoum and then operating out of them.With concern growing that the conflict may entangle other nations, observers were paying close attention to Egypt, which has enmeshed itself deeply into the affairs of its neighbor.Since 2019, when pro-democracy protesters forced Sudan's autocratic president to step down, Egypt has been eager to keep a civilian-led democracy from taking root on its southern doorstep, analysts have said. Ruled by a military-backed government that came to power after its own antigovernment uprising in 2011, Egypt has sought to replicate similar leadership in Sudan.Egyptian officials see a strongman as the best way of keeping its neighbor stable - and off a democratic path that could inspire Egyptians - and they have embraced General al-Burhan as an ally, especially after one Rapid Support Forces faction captured Egyptian soldiers and seven Egyptian warplanes over the weekend.The fighting has made transit in and out of the country difficult. At the main airport in Khartoum, airplanes were targeted again on Monday as the rival military factions fought for control over critical infrastructure.The New York Times, using satellite imagery, has identified 20 planes that have been destroyed or badly damaged at the airport since the conflict erupted.On Monday evening, residents of the city of Omdurman, northwest of the capital, said the situation was quiet, with many people coming out of their homes and traffic gradually building in some shopping areas. Many households, however, still lacked water or electricity.In the capital, many residents found it safest to stay home. Mr. Abuhurira, the electrical engineer who went out to charge his phone, said that in the half-hour he spent on the street, he encountered almost no one.The few people he did run across, he said, looked "like a zombie - without a soul or spirit."

        The Sudanese Army and a paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces were once aligned. The R.S.F. fought on behalf of the Sudanese Army, until its outgrown influence and the ambitions of its leader, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, put the two groups in direct confrontation.The Rapid Support Forces can trace its origins to the notorious Janjaweed militias, which in the 2000s helped Sudan's Army crush a rebellion in the western region of Darfur. While the military had an air force and heavy weapons, the Janjaweed provided on-the-ground fighters in isolated areas.An estimated 300,000 people were killed in the conflict between 2003 and 2008, and 2.5 million more were displaced, according to the United Nations. The International Criminal Court opened investigations into the genocidal violence, indicting Sudan's longtime dictator, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2009.Mr. al-Bashir was adamant about giving the group an institutional veneer, and in 2013, it became the R.S.F., with members first deployed as border guards, then as mercenaries for a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, mostly known as Hemeti, is a former Janjaweed leader who was once backed by Mr. al-Bashir, but who eventually helped oust him following a popular uprising in 2019.In 2021, General Hamdan and the army chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, staged another coup, and, until Saturday, the two had been sharing power.As General Hamdan's influence grew, along with his aspirations to lead the country, the two generals became enemies. The military had pushed to integrate the R.S.F. into its ranks, but the paramilitary group resisted.Experts and Western officials estimate the R.S.F. to number between 70,000 and 150,000 fighters. Its members include former military and intelligence officers, according to Roland Marchal, a sociologist at Sciences Po University in Paris and an expert on civil wars in Africa.In recent months, General Hamdan has recruited more fighters from the country's east and north in an attempt to widen his support base, according to Mr. Marchal.He has also deepened his connection to foreign powers, visiting Russia at the beginning of the war on Ukraine, partnering with the Wagner mercenary group to dig for gold in Sudan, and deploying troops in Yemen, to serve the interests of Saudi Arabia, and in Libya, for the United Arab Emirates.Still, the R.S.F. lacks the firepower of the military. The group doesn't have planes, for instance. And while R.S.F. fighters are used to operating in rural areas, they are not as well-trained for combat in cities like Khartoum, according to Mr. Marchal.

        For years, thousands of New Yorkers and tourists have walked past an unassuming office building in Lower Manhattan. On Monday, federal prosecutors unsealed criminal charges accusing two men of helping run an unauthorized Chinese police outpost there, one of more than 100 around the globe used to intimidate and control China's citizens abroad, and to stamp out criticism of the ruling Communist Party.The two men were arrested on Monday and charged with conspiring to act as agents of the Chinese government, and with obstructing justice. They are said to have used the police outpost to intimidate Chinese dissidents living in the United States, on China's behalf.Charges were also unveiled in two related cases: one against 34 Chinese police officers accused of harassing Chinese nationals who lived in the New York area, and another against eight Chinese officials accused of directing a Zoom employee based in China to remove dissidents from the platform.The Manhattan police outpost, court papers say, was overseen by the Fuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, a branch of China's Ministry of Public Security. It is one of scores of such operations around the world that have unnerved diplomats and intelligence officials.The case represents the first time criminal charges have been brought in connection with such a police outpost, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn.The charges against the men, Lu Jianwang, 61, also known as Harry Lu, and Chen Jinping, 59, grew out of an investigation by the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney's office into the outpost, which conducted its operations without jurisdiction or diplomatic approval."Today's charges are a crystal clear response to the P.R.C. that we are onto you, we know what you're doing and we will stop it from happening in the United States of America," Breon S. Peace, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn said, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China. "We don't need or want a secret police station in our great city."Officials described all three cases as being part of a worldwide effort to suppress criticism of China's government."The People's Republic of China, through its Ministry of Public Security, has engaged in a multifront campaign to extend the reach and impact of its authoritarian system into the United States and elsewhere around the world," said David Newman, the Justice Department's top national security official in Washington.F.B.I. counterintelligence agents searched the police outpost, located on the third floor of a nondescript glass-sheathed building at 107 East Broadway, as part of their investigation last fall.The six-story office building, on a bustling street on the edge of Chinatown in Lower Manhattan lined with restaurants, seafood shops, electronics stores and other businesses, also houses an acupuncturist, an engineering company and an accounting firm.The search amounted to an escalation in the global dispute over China's efforts to police its diaspora far beyond its borders.Officials in Ireland, Canada and the Netherlands have called on China to shut down similar operations in their countries. The F.B.I. raid in New York was the first known example of authorities seizing materials from one of the outposts.Mr. Lu and Mr. Chen were charged with obstruction of justice and accused of destroying text messages between themselves and their handler at the Ministry of Public Security in October 2022, around the time of the F.B.I. search.They were also charged with conspiring to act as agents of the People's Republic of China without registering with the Justice Department, as the law requires.The charges were announced Monday at a news conference in Brooklyn by Mr. Peace, Mr. Newman, and Michael Driscoll, the F.B.I. assistant director who leads the New York office.Mr. Lu, who is also known as Harry Lu, lives in the Bronx and maintains a residence in China. Mr. Chen lives in Manhattan. Both men are American citizens and were released on bail after appearances before a magistrate judge on Monday afternoon.Relatives of the men declined to comment. A court-appointed lawyer for Mr. Chen, Susan G. Kellman, said that he worked as a home health aide and owned no property to use as collateral.In 2018 IRS filings, Mr. Lu was listed as the president of a nonprofit organization called the America Changle Association NY, whose offices housed the police outpost.A criminal complaint unsealed on Monday said that the group was formed in 2013 and lists its charitable mission as a "social gathering place" for people from the Chinese city of Fuzhou. The complaint says Mr. Lu serves as the association's general adviser and Mr. Chen as its secretary general.When news that the F.B.I. had searched the Manhattan office was first reported in January, the Chinese Embassy in Washington downplayed the role of the police outposts, saying they were staffed by volunteers who helped Chinese nationals perform routine tasks like renewing their driver's licenses back home.But the American authorities said that they were clearly focused on monitoring members of the Chinese diaspora and infringing on their right to free speech."It is our belief that the ultimate purpose of this illegal police station was not to protect and serve," Mr. Driscoll said, "but rather silence, harass and threaten individuals here in the United States."The two other cases revolved around political speech in the digital sphere. But all of the defendants are believed to be in China, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States.One expanded a case first filed in 2020, in which prosecutors brought charges against Xinjiang Jin, formerly a China-based executive at the videoconferencing company Zoom, accusing him of disrupting and censoring commemorations of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.The amended complaint unsealed on Monday expands the charges to eight Chinese officials and another person who prosecutors say directed the activity.The remaining case charged 34 officers of China's Ministry of Public Security with operating a "troll farm" to attack Chinese dissidents, sow division and disseminate disinformation. The officers were part of an elite task force called the 912 Special Project Working Group, prosecutors said.The complaint alleges that the group created thousands of fake profiles on social media sites including Twitter, and spread propaganda about topics like human rights in Hong Kong and the Xinjiang region, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, unrest after the police killing of George Floyd, and Covid-19.

        For Mollie Gathro, live theater was a once-a-year indulgence if the stars aligned perfectly.Gathro has degenerative disc disease and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, resulting in joint pain, weakness and loss of mobility. Because of her disabilities, going to a show meant having to secure accessible seating after hourslong phone calls with her "nemesis," Ticketmaster; finding a friend to drive her or arranging other transportation; and hoping her body would cooperate enough for her to actually go out.But when live performance was brought to a halt three years ago by the coronavirus pandemic, and presenters turned to streaming in an effort to keep reaching audiences, the playing field was suddenly leveled for arts lovers like Gathro.From her home in West Springfield, Mass., Gathro suddenly had access to the same offerings as everyone else, watching streams of Gore Vidal's drama "The Best Man" and of a Guster concert at the Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado. For a while, it seemed, everything was online: performances by the Berlin State Opera or the Philadelphia Orchestra; dances by choreographers like Alonzo King and a New York City Ballet Spring Gala directed by Sofia Coppola; blockbuster movies that were released to streaming services at the same time they hit multiplexes; even the latest installment of Richard Nelson's acclaimed cycle of plays about the Apple family for the Public Theater was streamed live."I was overjoyed, but there was also this tentative feeling like waiting for the other shoe to drop because they could take the accessibility away just as easily as they gave it," Gathro, 35, said, "which feels like is exactly what is happening."It is happening. With live performance now back, and some theaters and concert halls still struggling to bring back audiences, presenters have cut back on their streamed offerings - leaving many people with disabilities and chronic illnesses, who have been calling for better virtual access for decades, excluded again.Livestreaming "opened up the door and showed us what is possible," said Celia Hughes, the executive director of Art Spark Texas, a nonprofit that aims to make the arts more inclusive and accessible. The door, she said, has begun to close again.Aimi Hamraie,​​ an associate professor of medicine, health and society at Vanderbilt University who studies disability access, said that the decisions to cut back on streaming options "were not made with disabled people in mind.""We've all been shown that we already have the tools to create more accessible exhibitions and performances, so people can no longer say it's not possible," Hamraie said. "We all know that that's not true."One in four adults in the United States has some form of disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But more than three decades after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act made it illegal to discriminate based on disability, advocates say that it remains difficult for many disabled people to navigate arts venues: gilded old theaters often have narrow aisles, cramped rows and stairs, while sleek modern spaces can be off-the-beaten-path or feature temporary seating on risers.To be sure, there are far more streaming options available now than there used to be. The San Francisco Opera has been livestreaming all of its productions this season, and last month the Paris Opera announced new streaming options. Second Stage Theater simulcast the last two weeks of its Broadway run of "Between Riverside and Crazy" and "Circle Jerk," a Zoom play that became a finalist for the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for drama, returned for a hybrid run last summer for both live and streaming audiences. The Cleveland Orchestra has joined the growing number of classical ensembles streaming select performances. And this year's Sundance Film Festival was held in person in Park City, Utah - but also online.But venues and producers have cut back on streaming for a number of reasons: the costs associated with equipment and the work required to film performances; contracts that call for paying artists and rights holders more money for streams; and fears that streams could provide more incentive for people to stay home rather than attend in person.Arts lovers with disabilities are feeling the loss."It made all the difference because I felt like during the pandemic, I was allowed to be part of the world again, and then I just lost it," said Dom Evans, 42, a hard-of-hearing filmmaker with spinal muscular atrophy, among other disabilities, and a co-creator of FilmDis, a group that monitors disability representation in the media.The recent experiments with streaming have raised questions of what counts as "live." Some events are heavily produced and edited before they are made available online."It's better than nothing, but it's not the same," Phoebe Boag, 43, a music fan with myalgic encephalomyelitis, who lives in Scotland, said in an email interview. "When you're watching a live performance at the same time as everyone else, you have the same anticipation leading up to the event, and there's a sense of community and inclusion, knowing that you're watching the performance alongside however many other people."More venues are providing programming specifically for people with disabilities and their families. Moments, at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, for example, is geared toward people with dementia and their caregivers. "Our main goal is that everyone has choice, everyone can get access to what they want in ways that work best for them," Miranda Hoffner, the associate director of accessibility at Lincoln Center, said.These types of programs have been welcomed. But others say that presenters must do more to make all of their programming accessible."We need arts programs that are fully integrated," Evans, the filmmaker, said.Even as presenters have cut back on streaming options, many have stopped requiring proof of vaccination and masks - placing new barriers to attendance for some of the estimated seven million American adults who have compromised immune systems that make them more likely to get severely ill from Covid-19."It's easy to feel just like you're farther and farther behind and not only forgotten, but just completely disregarded," said Han Olliver, a 26-year-old freelance artist and writer with multiple chronic illnesses who would like more access to the arts. "And that's really lonely."Still, new opportunities have led to more connections for and among disabled people.Theater Breaking Through Barriers, an Off Broadway company that promotes the inclusion of disabled actors onstage, has presented more than 75 short plays since 2020 that have been designed to be performed virtually. Last fall, it streamed a series of plays, including some that were created on Zoom and others that were performed in front of live audiences. Nicholas Viselli, the company's artistic director, said the goal is to make streaming more regular.There is an idea that "'doing virtual stuff is not really theater,' and I don't agree with that," Viselli said."It's not the same as being in the room and feeling the energy from the audience and the actors," he said, "but it is when you have artists creating something in front of your eyes."Gathro continues to take advantage of streaming options when she can from her home in West Springfield. But she hopes that more presenters will stream their work in the future."I wish I always had options for livestreaming, for really everything, because I would," Gathro said. "For me, it's worth paying as much as I would pay to see it in person. The accessibility is just that much more helpful."

        Alice and Diana don't like each other very much. Not at first. Diana, a teacher at the University of Ohio, considers Alice an intellectual lightweight and flaky. Alice, a faculty wife, finds Diana condescending."They are unlikely friends," Laura Linney, who plays Diana, said with understatement.And yet forced together for a few sticky Midwestern months by their young daughters, a relationship burgeons over kiddie pools and popsicles. Their friendship, which will eventually burn with the blue-flame intensity of a love affair, will profoundly alter each woman's life.This is the substance of David Auburn's memory play "Summer, 1976," a febrile two-hander directed by Daniel Sullivan and starring Linney and Jessica Hecht (Alice) as women in their 50s recalling a pivotal time in their 20s. The Manhattan Theater Club production, mostly composed of daisy-chained monologues, is scheduled to open April 25 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.On a recent weekday morning, the two women met in an otherwise empty rehearsal room at M.T.C.'s Midtown offices. This was a fraught moment in the process. "Week three in rehearsal for me is always a disaster, I'm so frustrated," Linney said. And Hecht was still starring in another show, Sarah Ruhl's "Letters From Max" at the Signature Theater. But the co-stars, dressed in drapey clothing, seemed relaxed enough.Both are stage and screen veterans who have worked with Sullivan - Hecht long ago in "The Heidi Chronicles," Linney most recently in "The Little Foxes" - but never together. They were learning the play by listening, raptly, to each other."It's like being in a romance of sorts," Hecht said.Over midmorning coffee - "Sometimes there's god, so quickly," Linney said, quoting Tennessee Williams, when the drinks arrived - the two women discussed the play, the process and why they keep returning to the theater. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.What do you remember about 1976?JESSICA HECHT My mother's divorce and her consciousness raising group.LAURA LINNEY I can remember wearing Corkys and feeling very cool with my Lip Smackers and my shampoo that smelled like wheat germ.What attracted you to these characters?LINNEY I wasn't attracted to the character at first. I have no idea of who a character is until I've been working for several weeks. So for me, it was really the combination of people. If Dan Sullivan whispers my name, I'll show up. Honestly, I will do anything that man wants me to do. And I so wanted to do it with Jess, because she is so amazing. Also, hurray for a new play!HECHT I never told you, but before they had officially asked me to do the play, I saw Dan on the corner of 93rd and Broadway. And he said, "Have you worked with Laura?" And I said, "No, I haven't worked with her." And he said, "She's the real deal." And it is true, because you have a clarity of purpose. We share that. For me, I'm interested in plays that talk about intimacy.LINNEY This was a time before cellphones, before the internet. Friendships were very deep. The effort that you would happily make to continue a relationship or a friendship! And the romance that went with not being able to have access to someone immediately.So once you'd signed on, what work has gone into building these characters?HECHT My approach is kind of internal. It's really based on the language and how the story is working. It's quite annoying.LINNEY No, not at all.HECHT I always worry that my technique annoys the other actors. Do you ever get that feeling? That this must be frustrating to the other person?LINNEY I love watching someone else's process. How do you do this crazy thing that we do? Because we are all so different, it's always exciting to see where the intersection is between the actor and the character. What is it that's letting them in, bringing blood to the character? Like, where do they find their way in?I'm the daughter of a playwright. So I tend to be text-based. I try to listen to what the play is telling me to do. I work on it and work on it and work on it. Then there comes a period of time where it literally lifts up off the page and it becomes a three-dimensional living thing. Then it starts to work on me. It doesn't always happen. But it's exciting when it does.So who are these women? Who is Alice?HECHT Alice has a kind of impulsivity about relating to people and an attraction to different people. That excites me. I definitely was that person.And who's Diana?HECHT She's such a mystery. She's so complicated.LINNEY There's the question of who is she really and who does she think she is. There's a big difference between the two. She wants to be an artist. It's important to her. It's more than a vocation. It's a sacred pact. And she suffers terribly for it. She is uncompromising, she is opinionated. She is astute and perceptive and diagnostic. She also doesn't really know who she is or what she needs or what she wants.Why is this friendship so intense?HECHT They both really feel that need to have somebody as a partner. With Alice, Diana teaches her so much.LINNEY They're attracted to the qualities that they don't have, but that the other person has in abundance. And there's a sense of belonging to each other. There's a sense of family, there's a sense of chemistry. When you click with someone, it's really powerful.HECHT Being friends with Diana is almost like having an affair, it changes Alice's whole metabolism.LINNEY You're chemically altered. And you're spiritually rearranged.You're about four weeks into rehearsal, what have you learned about the play?HECHT Yesterday we did our first run of the play without our books in hand. And it was so scary, but we got through.LINNEY We're learning a lot. I don't think any of us have pretensions that we have all the answers. Maybe that's the one thing that shows how long we've been doing this. If you're too knowing, there's no room for growth.What's the joy and terror of a two-hander, of having to rely so much on each other?LINNEY The joy is the intimacy and the bond and that you're not alone up there. There's a total interdependence. The biggest fear is that I won't be able to help her if she gets into trouble.HECHT Yeah, that we would let the other person down.LINNEY The language is very difficult. We never stop talking. We're going to mess up. We're human beings. There's just the fear that we will mess up in a way that derails the show.You both have spent a lot of your career on television. What keeps you returning to the theater?HECHT I feel very, very committed to our community. Being part of this community is definitely the biggest accomplishment of my professional life. I feel a tremendous amount of energy and human connection to the people I act with and the people I act for. Nothing else replicates that.LINNEY It's a family profession. I have a history with it that goes beyond me. I also strongly believe that it is a part of public good. Theater provides a nourishment, intellectually and emotionally and spiritually, to audiences. And I love the ritual. There is a connection to the work that's much deeper than anything you can do on television and film. Because we are doing it from beginning to end, eight shows a week.HECHT It is a religion. Someone said to me the other day, "Oh, that is my religion. Being in the theater."LINNEY People ask me, "What church did you grow up in?" I'm like, "The theater." Everything that's important about life I've learned in the theater.

        Most people would like to consider themselves geniuses, but what does it take to become a Spelling Bee Genius?Spelling Bee is one of five games created by the New York Times Games team, where players try to make words from a set of seven unique letters while using the center letter at least once. It's easy to learn, but takes practice to master.Some of our most die-hard players - collectively known as the "Hivemind" - responded to our question with helpful tricks for getting to the top score.Sometimes it helps to look at things from a different angle. Turning the letters in the hive by using the shuffle button can help you recognize letter combinations and words that you may not see if they remain static.If you were not aware of this feature, it can be found directly below the hive.Not all word-making games allow this, but the game is a lot more fun - and you can rack up more points - when you can reuse letters.The words MAMA and MAMMA pop up fairly often, for example, because they can be made when the common letters A and M are in the hive.Look at your list of "already found" words to see if you can add to them to make new words.If six of the letters in the hive are DITENU, for example, you can make the words TIED and UNTIED. That's one point for TIED, and UNTIED adds six more points to your score!Kris Nielsen-Morris, of Agoura Hills, Calif., suggests keeping a list in your mind of letter combinations that make long words, like C-O-N, which makes COCOON, and P-E-T, which makes TEEPEE and TEPEE.Even though the letter S is never included - the editor Sam Ezersky said that using an S would make the puzzle way too easy - plurals do exist in Spelling Bee."Be on the lookout for words such as TEETH, CELLI, ABACI (the plural of 'abacus'), WOMEN, FEET, CURRICULA, PHENOMENA and INDICIA, among others. They can be easily overlooked," said Monica Tarantino of Walton, N.Y., who goes by the screen name "Monicat" in the New York Times Spelling Bee forum. (Learn more about the forum in the resource section below).How you start the game depends largely on your own skill set, and no one way seems to be better than another.You can knock out a lot of four-letter words, worth one point, first - those points add up - and then move on to more challenging ones.Sometimes, however, pangrams (words that use all seven of the hive letters at least once) pop right out at you, and you can open with a seven-point victory. "Finding the pangram first is like opening a present that has lots of little packages inside," said Susan Rakov of Santa Barbara, Calif., because there may be words inside it that will also be counted.Sometimes you may spot smaller words that don't include the center letter but might be part of an accepted compound.Once you have entered the words that popped out at you immediately, it's time to drill down.Start with one letter and try to find all of the words beginning with that letter before you move on to the next one. It takes discipline not to skip around and adds a constraint to solving, but who are we to judge? You might find that fun and challenging."When you get stuck, leave and come back later with fresh eyes," said Sharon Kittredje of San Francisco.One of the best parts of Spelling Bee is that you can put it down and come back to it later in the day when you have time.When you're really stuck, "just stare at it," said Paula Dugmore of Cape Town. "Sometimes it's like looking at those 3-D posters; it takes a while to perceive the image and then you can't but see it. Just let the letters dance in front of your eyes, without trying too hard to order them - gives your subconscious brain a chance."Several readers advised newer players to look at words from the previous day's game and try to see what they missed to remember them for next time.Remember them, because you will see them again."Tried the hints once, but that felt like cheating. My hubby and I solve separately then compare notes. We always improve each other's score," said Nancy Howcraft of Rio Verde, Ariz.Is it possible that Spelling Bee also helps foster relationships? Ellen Brout Lindsay of Amherst, Mass., said: "I bought my 90-year-old mom an online subscription to the Bee for Mother's Day in 2020. We compare our scores every night and see if together we can get to Queen Bee. Sure beats talking about her health or politics!"We haven't even talked about the additional help that is available for Spelling Bee, and by "additional," we mean a lot. Read on.Many players believe that they need to solve a puzzle on their own, with no outside help whatsoever, to consider their victories "legitimate." That's a perfectly fine way to play, but others like to share their victories, and don't mind a little help to get there.If you would like to get hints about the day's game or just find Bee-addicted people to talk to, here are some of the best-known resources. If we have left anything or anyone out, please let us know in the comments section.We're biased, but here's where the real conversation takes place. Every day, hundreds of thousands of players read the forum, compiled by Isaac Aronow, the associate Wordplay editor, and Doug Mennella, a forum frequenter.Whether it's to help beginners, cheer on other players' victories or just to gripe that a word they know wasn't included, the hundreds of players who leave comments each day make it a lively internet pit stop. And it's just as much fun to drop by after you reach Genius as it is while you are playing. Spelling Bee players love playing with words, and they are fun people.The hints in the daily article include Mr. Mennella's helpful grid of counts by starting letter, as well as a list of the first two letters of each word, and how many words of that kind there are.And we would be remiss if we didn't mention the lovely bee photos. "Another reason to check the hints page is to admire the beautiful photos of bees at work, often with beautiful flowers - a new one every day. It's calming," said Marcia Ringel of Ridgewood, N.J.We apologize for leaving this all-important source of hints and community out of the survey, and we were certainly not planning to ignore the Twitter Hivemind.If you have a Twitter account, bookmark the hashtags #hivemind, #nytsb and #nytspellingbee to join the conversation. Some well-known people, like the comedian Steve Martin, have been known to weigh in.Chris McLeester publishes an extensive daily analysis of the Bee. Jenny Fey, of Arlington, Va., recommends using his site when stuck, to "see how many pangrams or words of a certain length there are." Answers are posted behind a link to avoid spoilers.Bill Shunn's online solver is useful and can be filtered using check boxes to avoid spoilers. Players can also find Mr. Shunn's solutions on Twitter at @beesolved.Keep trying and don't give up, many members of our Hivemind said."Don't get hooked into the words that should be there and aren't," Ms. Dugmore said. "Sam works in strange and mysterious ways and that's half the fun."Join us here to solve Crosswords, The Mini and other games by The New York Times.

        When a freight train carrying more than 100,000 gallons of hazardous chemicals derailed and burned in East Palestine, Ohio, this year, it set off a panic over rail safety and the toxic fallout for communities downwind.But less has been known about the origins of the chemicals themselves and their intended destination.Much of the train's vinyl chloride freight - which was ultimately incinerated by emergency responders to avert a wider explosion - came from a chemicals plant in La Porte, just outside Houston, Texas, that is run by OxyVinyls, the chemical arm of Occidental Petroleum, according to the shipment records released by the Environmental Protection Agency. The chemicals were on a 1,600-mile journey to an Oxy plant in Pedricktown, N.J., that makes plastic used in PVC flooring.The details of the cargo were included in an administrative order filed last month by the E.P.A. that was based on shipment data provided by Oxy and other shippers. Oxy had more than 700,000 pounds of vinyl chloride on the train that derailed, the records show. An E.P.A. official on Monday confirmed the accuracy of the information.Tracing the Norfolk Southern train's volatile load to its source sheds light on the environmental and health risks of the nation's soaring manufacturing and use of plastics. The chemicals shipped by Oxy were key ingredients in PVC, a rigid material widely used in water pipes, furniture, floor tiles and packaging.Plastic manufacturing is booming in America, fueled by cheap and plentiful shale gas. It has become an increasingly important business for Occidental, a major oil company based in Houston, as nations start moving away from the burning of fossil fuels, the main driver of climate change.Texas and Louisiana, in particular, have become global chemical hubs as oil and gas companies expand their plastics production to offset the possibility of declining demand for oil as fuel.While tiny East Palestine has drawn considerable attention for the inferno and its potential health consequences, communities nationwide are regularly grappling with the health and safety implications of the surge in chemical manufacturing and transportation.Last year at Oxy's La Porte plant, a midnight explosion and fire drew a major response by emergency personnel. More recently, some of the firefighting wastewater from the Ohio train fire, which contained toxic chemicals, was trucked back to a processing facility in Deer Park, Texas, which borders La Porte. And in 2012, a train carrying vinyl chloride - bound for the same plastics plant in New Jersey that was the destination of the Ohio train - derailed and plunged into a creek, releasing 23,000 gallons of the chemical and prompting evacuations of nearby homes.OxyVinyls plans to spend $1.1 billion to expand and upgrade its La Porte plant, the company said in regulatory filings last year. Shintech, the world's largest producer of PVC, and whose shipments also burned in the Ohio disaster, according to freight records, is spending more than $2 billion to build out its operations in Texas and Louisiana.Oxy officials didn't respond to several requests for comment.Overall, chemicals companies have invested more than $100 billion in new or expanded plants since 2010, with another $99 billion in the works, according to a tally from the American Chemistry Council. Much of that investment has been in plastics.As plastic production has proliferated, more hazardous materials have been on the move. According to data from the Association for American Railroads, rail shipments of chemicals used in plastic production grew by about a third over the past decade.Chemicals have become a particularly important business for railways because one of their traditional mainstays, coal transportation, has fallen steeply with the drastic decline in the mining and burning of coal. Over the past decade, coal traveling by rail fell by almost half. Agricultural rail cargo, like grain and soybeans, has stayed flat.While derailments have declined since the 1970s, the costs of derailments of trains carrying hazardous materials have increased. Most accidents, injuries and deaths involving hazardous materials in transit happen on the road, and incidents there have jumped by more than 50 percent since 2012, according to Bureau of Transportation statistics.For residents at the starting points for these shipments, concerns over exposure to cancer-causing substances have long been a constant."You get headaches, you get nauseous, and you get chronic respiratory issues that affect you," said Sema Hernandez, a community organizer who lives with her four children about a half-mile from Oxy's La Porte facility. Headline-grabbing accidents like the Ohio derailment may bring temporary attention to chemical hazards, she said, but for communities like hers with chemical plants as close neighbors, they are a daily threat."It could be a normal day, and all of a sudden there's a siren that goes off that tells you, this is not a drill, to shelter in place," she said. "That can happen at any time."Though making plastics doesn't typically involve burning the oil used in manufacturing them, the production process brings with it other potential hazards. Since the 1970s, for example, numerous studies have found that workers exposed to vinyl chloride, which is made from fossil fuels and is primarily used to manufacture PVC, developed malignant liver cancers. Vinyl chloride has also been linked to brain and lung cancers, lymphoma and leukemia.An analysis published this month by Toxic-Free Future, a nonprofit that advocates safer products and chemicals, found that PVC plastics plants reported releasing more than 400,000 pounds of vinyl chloride into the air in 2021. It also found that people of color were overrepresented in communities near such plants, making up more than 60 percent of the almost 400,000 people who live within three miles of a vinyl-chloride, PVC-manufacturing or PVC-waste-disposal facility, compared with the 40 percent share they make up of the general population.United Nations officials said in 2021 that pollution-linked cancer risks in predominantly African American districts near a cluster of petrochemical plants along the Mississippi River far surpassed those in districts with predominantly white populations. Last month, residents of St. James Parish, La., at the heart of that region, sued the local council for a pattern of racist land use practices that has placed petrochemical plants in predominantly Black neighborhoods.In recent days, an unrelated fire at a plastics recycling plant in Indiana highlighted the risks at the end of the plastics life cycle. Recyclers nationwide have been struggling to process all the growing supply of discarded plastic, which can end up in piles at facilities in what experts have long called a fire hazard.Some cities in the United States and elsewhere, including New York, Boston, Seattle and San Francisco, have adopted policies aimed at phasing out the use of PVC and other products linked to pollution, limiting public purchases and mandating alternatives. A handful of countries, including Canada, Spain and South Korea, have restricted or banned the use of PVC packaging, and legislators have pursued a similar ban in California.Sweden, which adopted restrictions on PVC use almost three decades ago, is phasing out its use altogether, for example, by replacing PVC packaging with less toxic kinds of plastic, including plant-based materials.

        After four people were killed and 32 others, mostly teenagers, were injured in a shooting at a 16th birthday party in a small city in Alabama on Saturday night, residents returned to work and school on Monday with no official information about who opened fire or why.On Monday evening, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said police were still processing evidence and had recovered shell cases from the shooting at the Mahogany Masterpiece dance studio in Dadeville, which has a population of about 3,000 people and is about 60 miles northeast of Montgomery. No evidence of high-powered rifle ammunition was found, the agency said in a statement.The Tallapoosa County Coroner, Mike Knox, on Monday identified the four victims who died as Shaunkivia Nicole Smith, known as Keke, 17; Philstavious Dowdell, 19; Marsiah Emmanuel Collins, 19; and Corbin Dahmontrey Holston, 23.Community leaders, including the police, school officials and clergy members, described the town as close-knit. The shooting at about 10:34 p.m. on Saturday night shattered that placid atmosphere. Officials have not said if they have identified a suspect or suspects, made any arrests or found a motive.Seven miles outside the city, on Highway 280, a digital billboard above an auto dealer had become a roadside memorial. One image said "Pray for Dadeville," and the screen advanced through pictures of the victims, including Alexis Dowdell kissing her brother Phil on the cheek and Keke Nicole Smith smiling on the sidelines of a game."Dadeville is a very small community. It's just really difficult," Heidi Smith, a spokeswoman for Lake Martin Community Hospital in Dadeville, said at a news conference on Monday morning.The hospital treated 15 teenagers with gunshot wounds, she said. Six had been discharged and nine were transferred to other hospitals. Of the nine, five were in critical condition and four were in stable condition.Ms. Smith said that the hospital staff had undergone training for shootings and other crises, but there was no way to actually prepare."It's very traumatic in a health care setting, an emergency room setting, when you have one gunshot wound come through," Ms. Smith said. "But when you have 15, and they are all teenagers - our staff has been through a lot."Ms. Smith said that the hospital would provide free counseling to its staff as well as to children at the high school and the families of the victims. She said a hospital worker on the night shift had called to ask to be first in line for help.James Ryan, a native of Calera, Ala., who had moved to Dadeville in 2016 and chose to stay there because he found the city safe and quiet, lamented the violence taking young lives."I just hate that this happened here," Mr. Ryan said. "There's got to be something done about the guns."The United States is an extreme outlier for gun violence, especially in its high number of young victims, compared with similarly large and wealthy nations. In 2020, gun violence surpassed car accidents and disease to become the leading killer of children.Dadeville had experienced a shooting with multiple victims in August 2016, when five people were shot at a party in the American Legion Hall, less than half a mile from the dance studio where the shooting took place on Saturday.The dance studio is in an old bank building on North Broadnax, a main thoroughfare that runs though the historic downtown business district. On Monday morning, the American flag and the state flag flew at half-staff at city buildings and the front doors of the Dadeville Public Library were draped in ribbon-wreaths of black and gold, the local high school's colors.Two of the teenagers who were killed in the shooting were seniors at Dadeville High School.Shaunkivia Nicole Smith was a volleyball player and team manager for the high school's track team. Michael Taylor, who coached the track team that Ms. Smith managed at Dadeville High School, described her as "full of life."Mr. Taylor said on Sunday that the shooting was at a birthday party for the younger sister of one of the victims, Philstavious Dowdell, who was a Dadeville High School football player. Mr. Dowdell had committed to Jacksonville State University. The head coach of the university's football team, Rich Rodriguez, said in a statement that Mr. Dowdell was a "great young man with a bright future."Mr. Dowdell's sister was a cheerleader who cheered for every sport at the high school and many of the athletes had come out to her party to celebrate, Mr. Taylor said.Corbin Dahmontrey Holston had played basketball and football at Dadeville High School. Marsiah Emmanuel Collins, 19, had played football at Opelika High School, which is about 26 miles southeast of Dadeville.Mr. Collins's father, Martin Collins, told AL.com that his son had graduated in 2022 and had planned to attend Louisiana State University in the fall."He was a great big brother to his sisters," Mr. Collins said. "He was a funny, charismatic kid who loved to light up a room."

        In what has taken on the trappings of a grudge match, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida punched Disney anew on Monday, announcing new legislation that would override the company's recent effort to sidestep state oversight of its theme parks.Mr. DeSantis also suggested a variety of potential punitive actions against Disney - the state's largest private employer and corporate taxpayer - including reappraising the value of Walt Disney World for property tax levies and developing land near the entrances to the resort."Maybe create a state park, maybe try to do more amusement parks - someone even said, like, maybe you need another state prison," Mr. DeSantis said at a news conference near Disney World.Two weeks ago, Mr. DeSantis - a leading Republican presidential contender although he has not officially declared that he is running - floated the idea of raising taxes on Disney hotels and imposing tolls on roads that lead to its theme parks. He has also requested an investigation by Florida's chief inspector general into Disney's efforts to circumvent his authority.Disney declined to comment on Monday.Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, previously characterized Mr. DeSantis as "anti-business" and "anti-Florida" for his actions. Mr. Iger has also signaled that future investment in Disney World could be at risk if the governor continued to use Disney as a political punching bag; the company has earmarked more than $17 billion in spending at the resort over the next decade, growth that would create an estimated 13,000 jobs at the company.Mr. Iger said the unspecified expansion plans would attract more visitors to Florida and "generate more taxes." Disney paid and collected a total of $1.2 billion in state and local taxes in 2022, according to company disclosures.Mr. DeSantis and the Walt Disney Company have been sparring for more than a year over a tax district that encompasses Disney World, the 25,000-acre resort south of Orlando that employs 75,000 people and attracts 50 million visitors annually. The district, created in 1967, effectively turned the property into its own county, giving Disney unusual control over fire protection, policing, road maintenance and development planning.After Disney criticized a contentious state education law and halted political donations in Florida, Mr. DeSantis and the Florida Legislature restricted Disney's autonomy by appointing a handpicked oversight board for the district. (Previously, Disney selected the board members.) But the new appointees and the governor discovered in late March that the Disney-controlled board, as one of its final actions, had pushed through a development agreement that would limit the new board's power for decades to come.The maneuver, which Disney has defended as entirely legal and done in "open, noticed public forums," enraged the governor's appointees and generated humiliating media coverage for him: Mr. DeSantis, outwitted by a mouse.On Monday, Mr. DeSantis said the Legislature would introduce a bill, likely next week, that would "revoke" the last-minute development agreement - which he called a "statutory scheme" and a "sham" - and return power to his board appointees. He also said an effort was underway to give the state new authority over ride safety inspections at Disney World, as well as its monorail transportation system. Based on the governor's comments, it appeared that the state's two other large theme park companies, Universal and SeaWorld, would not be subject to additional safety inspections."They are not superior to the laws that are enacted by the people of the state of Florida," Mr. DeSantis said of Disney. He framed his actions as "the people's will."To many, it appears more like a tussle designed to heighten his own political ambitions - to dominate Disney and force it to bow down. Mr. DeSantis routinely rails against the company, which he calls a "woke" corporation, at events both in state and out of state. He often describes the fight in personal terms, including by saying "there's a new sheriff in town" who will no longer allow Disney to have outsized sway in Florida."It's hitting the point of absurdity," Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state representative from the Orlando area, told The Orlando Sentinel on April 8. "It's about DeSantis looking big and bad next to Disney." Florida newspaper columnists and editorial boards have also criticized his campaign. "Let. It. Go," wrote The Sentinel on April 2 in an editorial, referencing the popular song from the Disney movie "Frozen."Others applaud him. Carolina Amesty, a Republican state representative whose district includes the Disney World area, appeared with Mr. DeSantis on Monday and blasted the company for several grievances, including "indoctrinating" children with "radical gender ideologies.""They have pushed far-left narratives and lies about our great state and now they think that the rules don't apply to them," Ms. Amesty said. "Well, I have news for the woke administration at Disney: This is not California."

        A Moscow court on Monday sentenced an outspoken critic of the Kremlin to 25 years in prison, an unusually harsh punishment that underscores President Vladimir V. Putin's increasing determination to equate dissent with treason.The sentence given to Vladimir Kara-Murza, an opposition activist and journalist who had urged the American government to impose sanctions on Russian officials, is longer than what is often given for murder in Russia, and greater than the time being served by other imprisoned Putin critics, like Aleksei A. Navalny.It represents the latest chilling example of the Kremlin's wartime repression 14 months after the invasion of Ukraine, and comes less than three weeks after the arrest on espionage charges of Evan Gershkovich, an American correspondent for The Wall Street Journal based in Russia."We live in 2023, in the 21st century," Mr. Kara-Murza's mother, Yelena Gordon, told reporters outside the courthouse after the sentencing. "What is this? What is happening?"Mr. Kara-Murza, 41, who writes a column for The Washington Post's opinion section, was arrested in Moscow a year ago after condemning the war in Ukraine and charged with spreading "fake" information about the Russian military. In October, Russian prosecutors added a charge of treason, alleging that he had betrayed his country by criticizing Mr. Putin's rule in public appearances in the United States and Europe, according to Mr. Kara-Murza's lawyer.The 25-year sentence handed down on Monday combined the penalties in those two cases, as well as another sentence added last summer for participation in an "undesirable organization."It was a reminder that whatever its struggles to assert control on the battlefields of Ukraine, the Kremlin is firmly in charge at home, and prepared to brand any domestic critics as enemies of the state."Traitors and betrayers," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement about Mr. Kara-Murza on Monday, "will get what they deserve."Mr. Kara-Murza had long drawn the Kremlin's ire, and survived what he characterized several years ago as two state-sponsored attempts to poison him.Both inside Russia and in the West, Mr. Kara-Murza, who has Russian and British citizenship, spoke out against Mr. Putin and his invasion of Ukraine; last year, hours before his detention, he called Russia's rulers "a regime of murderers" in an interview with CNN.In London, the British government said it had summoned the Russian ambassador to protest Mr. Kara-Murza's conviction as "contrary to Russia's international obligations on human rights, including the right to a fair trial." The State Department called Mr. Kara-Murza "yet another target of the Russian government's escalating campaign of repression," while the United Nations human rights office declared his sentence "a blow to the rule of law."Russia's Foreign Ministry dismissed the international criticism as "an attempt to exert pressure on the Russian judicial system" that was "doomed to failure." Referring to "traitors" like Mr. Kara-Murza who "are applauded in the West," the ministry said: "Their foreign handlers will not help them avoid a just punishment."Mr. Putin did not comment publicly on Mr. Kara-Murza's sentencing, but he has repeatedly exhorted Russia's law enforcement and security agencies to escalate their hunt for opponents of his leadership, whom the Kremlin increasingly defines as agents trying to topple Mr. Putin on America's behalf."I'm asking you to react harshly to attempts to destabilize the social and political situation in the country," Mr. Putin said in a speech to Russian prosecutors last month.In the Russia justice system, verdicts are often foregone conclusions, especially for opponents of the Kremlin. It was the length of the prison term that was bracing.Mr. Kara-Murza's sentence far exceeds that of Mr. Navalny, the most prominent Russian opposition figure, who initially received a two-and-a-half-year prison term in 2021 and was given another nine-year sentence last year. And though it appears to be the longest handed down to a Kremlin critic in the last year, hundreds of others are also facing yearslong prison terms for speaking out against the war, human rights groups say.Ilya Yashin, an opposition leader, was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in December; the authorities accused him of spreading false information about atrocities committed in the Ukrainian city of Bucha by Russian troops.For Mr. Kara-Murza, the activity that appeared to bring him directly into the Kremlin's cross hairs was his campaign in Washington more than a decade ago for the Magnitsky Act, which punished officials deemed responsible for the death of a tax lawyer in a Russian jail.One of the Russians who fell under those sanctions after Congress passed the measure in 2012 was Sergei Podoprigorov - the same judge who delivered Monday's sentence against Mr. Kara-Murza in Moscow City Court.Mr. Kara-Murza's attorney, Vadim Prokhorov, said that the clear "conflict of interest" on display with Mr. Podoprigorov presiding over Mr. Kara-Murza's case made it plain that the entire proceeding was a sham."Everybody knows that Vladimir himself is one of the main initiators and promoters of the Magnitsky Act," Mr. Prokhorov said at a panel discussion hosted by The Washington Post on Monday, referring to Mr. Kara-Murza. "This case had nothing to do with justice. It is just political revenge against Vladimir."Fred Ryan, the publisher of The Post, said that both Mr. Kara-Murza and The Journal's Mr. Gershkovich were "real-time examples of the risks that journalists face and the need for all of us to use our voices to call for our elected leaders to take every possible step to secure their release."In February, Mr. Prokhorov said that Mr. Kara-Murza had been put into solitary confinement, where his health began to deteriorate rapidly. Last month, Mr. Prokhorov said that doctors had diagnosed his client with polyneuropathy, a serious nerve disorder that manifested itself in the numbness of his feet, a condition that was caused by his poisonings."This disease is difficult to treat even in freedom and moreover it's absolutely difficult, maybe impossible, to treat in the conditions of the prison," Evgenia Kara-Murza, Mr. Kara-Murza's wife, said at Monday's event in Washington. "It's possible to claim that this long years imprisonment for him is quite some kind of death penalty."Mr. Kara-Murza's supporters said the length of the sentence evoked the terror of the Stalin era - and of the repression faced by his own family.Two of Mr. Kara-Murza's great-grandfathers were executed as spies and "enemies of the people" during Stalin's purges, according to Meduza, a Russian news website. His grandfather was arrested in 1937 and served a sentence in labor camps in Russia's Far East. His father, Vladimir Kara-Murza Sr., was a prominent Russian liberal journalist until his death in 2019.Mr. Kara-Murza, jailed last April, continued writing his Washington Post column from prison, and has sought to rally Western support for Russian dissidents. In a January piece, for instance, he criticized Western governments for not having acted more aggressively in the early years of Mr. Putin's rule to promote media freedom in Russia.Supporting independent Russian media now operating from exile, he went on, is among "the most important steps the free world could take to further undermine the Kremlin's hateful messaging."In his final address to the court last week, Mr. Kara-Murza likened the current climate in Russia to the Stalin years."The day will come when the darkness over our country will dissipate," he said. "When black will be called black, and white will be called white; when at the official level, it will be recognized that two times two is still four; when a war will be called a war, and a usurper a usurper."

            <h2>How Nikki Haley's Campaign Inflated Her Fund-Raising Haul</h2>

        Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador, has staked her presidential run on an image as a straight shooter, with experience and drama-free competence.This weekend, though, it became clear that the impressive early fund-raising numbers her campaign promoted this month had been inflated, apparently because of double-counted money.The campaign had broadcast an $11 million haul in its opening six weeks, through the end of the first-quarter filing period on March 31. But when three of her affiliated committees filed reports on Saturday, the math did not add up.Instead, the three committees appeared to have taken in about $8.3 million, including $2.7 million that one of the committees transferred to two other committees and that was double-counted in the overall figure.On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ms. Haley said other campaigns had accounted for their money similarly in the past.The muddied accounting exposes the risks of building a campaign-finance operation with a patchwork of committees, which has become standard for presidential candidates. Ms. Haley is backed by four affiliated entities registered with the Federal Election Commission, three of which made filings on Saturday.Team Stand for America, her joint fund-raising committee, solicits contributions that are then divided between three entities: her presidential campaign committee, a multicandidate political action committee and a hybrid PAC (which did not file on Saturday).According to its filing on Saturday, Team Stand for America raised nearly $4.3 million in contributions in the first quarter. It also transferred $2.7 million to affiliated committees, and here is where the math got tricky. Without those transfers, the total raised by the three committees was $8.3 million, not $11 million.Ms. Haley's principal campaign committee - Nikki Haley for President - disclosed that it had taken in $5.1 million in receipts. But only $3.3 million of that sum came from contributions: The remaining $1.8 million came from Team Stand for America in two transfers recorded on March 31, the filings show.Stand for America PAC, a group that supports her but can also raise money for other candidates, reported $1.5 million in receipts - but just $600,000 of that came from contributions, the filing shows. The PAC received $886,000 in transferred money from Team Stand for America on March 31.In offering the original $11 million figure, the campaign added up the total receipts for the three groups - $5.1 million, $4.3 million and $1.5 million - without accounting for the fact that $2.7 million was being moved between the groups.Not much. There is nothing inaccurate about the filings themselves - they appear to add up - and there is nothing new about campaigns overhyping their fund-raising.And $8.3 million is still a sizable haul for the first six weeks of a presidential campaign. In comparison, former President Donald J. Trump's campaign disclosed $9.5 million in receipts in January for the first six weeks of his official bid.A spokeswoman for Ms. Haley did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.In 2021, Mr. Trump's advisers announced, inaccurately, that his affiliated political committees had raised nearly $82 million in the first six months of the year. That figure improperly counted at least $23 million in transfers to new political action committees from other accounts, The New York Times found.Mr. Trump's joint campaign committee - which has been the main vessel for his fund-raising this election cycle - raised $18.8 million in the first quarter, his campaign has said. It transferred $14 million to his principle campaign committee, according to filings Saturday.

        BOSTON - The Boston Marathon can humble even the most decorated champions. Runners who are new to its topography might get the wrong idea at the start, thanks to an opening chunk of Route 135 that unspools toward Ashland, Mass. It is downhill and fast, offering a bit of sadistic sleight of hand that masks the climbs to come as the course works its way toward Boylston Street in Boston.It is one thing to study a map and be forewarned. It is another thing altogether to lace up your carbon-plated super sneakers and experience it firsthand.On Monday, the 127th edition of the Boston Marathon served up its usual grab bag of triumphs and small calamities. In defending his men's title, Evans Chebet of Kenya used his experience to separate himself from a celebrated field that included Eliud Kipchoge, the world-record holder. And Hellen Obiri exercised patience to make it a Kenyan sweep by taking the women's crown in only her second marathon."When it comes to running a marathon, anything can happen," said Obiri, 33, who embraced her 7-year-old daughter, Tania, after crossing the finish line in 2 hours 21 minutes 38 seconds. "It's a long, long way."A long, long way for about 30,000 athletes who tackled the course amid cold, early-morning drizzles, and a long, long way for Kipchoge, the biggest luminary of them all.Kipchoge, 38, arrived in Boston last week having achieved nearly everything that there is to achieve in the sport of running, winning two Olympic gold medals and 10 world marathon majors. Last year, he broke his own world record when he won the Berlin Marathon for the fourth time in 2:01:09.But he had never run Boston, which is notorious for its rolling hills. And only rarely has he had to settle for bib No. 2, but Monday was one of those days. Bib No. 1 belonged to Chebet, 34, as the defending champion.Still, Kipchoge seemed determined to assert himself from the start, leading the elite men through the opening mile in a lung-searing 4:35. And there he stayed, up at the front, all the way to Mile 20, when Chebet made a surge and Kipchoge crumbled.Chebet and Benson Kipruto, the 2021 champion, are training partners, and they agreed to work together. They even shared a water bottle a couple of miles from the finish. More important, neither seemed in awe of Kipchoge. In fact, they appeared motivated by his presence, as if they had something to prove against him."Our confidence in the quality of our training made us feel good about taking on this race," Chebet said.Chebet won in 2:05:54. Gabriel Geay of Tanzania finished second, and Kipruto was third. Kipchoge finished sixth in 2:09:23, his poorest showing since he placed eighth at the London Marathon in 2020.Kipchoge, who did not appear at a post-race news conference, congratulated his competitors in a statement released to race organizers."I live for the moments where I get to challenge the limits," he said. "It's never guaranteed, it's never easy. Today was a tough day for me. I pushed myself as hard as I could. But sometimes, we must accept that today wasn't the day to push the barrier to a greater height."Chebet, who also won the New York City Marathon in November, said Monday's win was the greatest result of his career. He became the first man since Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot in 2008 to defend his Boston title."I'm happy because I know this race," Chebet said. "So maybe next year I'll come back and win it again."Obiri approached Boston as something of a marathon neophyte, even though she was already a legend on the global running stage. She is the only woman to have won world titles in indoor track, outdoor track and cross-country. She also has two Olympic silver medals in the 5,000 meters.Last year, she joined the On Athletics Club and moved to Boulder, Colo., so she could be coached by Dathan Ritzenhein, the former Olympic marathoner. Obiri's younger teammates sometimes refer to their training runs with her as doing "Obiri miles," which means they are hard miles.But like Kipchoge, Obiri is not immune to tough tests and even the occasional mistake. When she made her marathon debut in New York in November, she went out too hard - she doubled as a "pacemaker," she said - and faded to a sixth-place finish. She also erred by failing to consume enough water and electrolytes. In hindsight, Ritzenhein said, the experience taught her a great deal."It really made her fear and respect the event," he said.But Obiri was not exactly in a rush to do another marathon. A few days after she won the New York City Half Marathon last month, Ritzenhein gauged her interest in entering Boston. Obiri asked if she could have a week to think it over."No," Ritzenhein recalled telling her, "text me tonight."Obiri decided to go for it. Ritzenhein said her training, which included a long, consistent stretch of 100-mile weeks, gave him the confidence that she could excel in Boston, with a fresh opportunity to put many of the lessons she had learned into practice. Ritzenhein advised her to be cautious through the first 21 miles."She was smart and just waited," he said. "I didn't think she could wait as long as she did."Obiri is a ferocious runner, with long, loping strides. And at Mile 24, she pushed forward. The wait was over. Ritzenhein said he could sense as much from her stride. "The power came out," he said.Obiri doubled over with emotion after she crossed the finish line. Amane Beriso of Ethiopia was 12 seconds back in second place, and Lonah Salpeter of Israel finished third."I was feeling like my body was ready and everything was ready," Obiri said. "And I said to myself, I can't do it from the front. If I can just wait, wait - because my coach told me that the marathon is about patience. So I tried to be patient until the right time."Emma Bates, a native of Elk River, Minn., ran in the lead pack for much of the race and placed fifth as the top American. Scott Fauble finished seventh as the top American man.

        The National Endowment for the Humanities announced on Tuesday the 258 beneficiaries of its newest round of grants, the first of three rounds to be awarded this year. Among the projects will be restorations to the U.S.S. Intrepid, a historic aircraft carrier that is the centerpiece of the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum in New York; a documentary exploring the legacy of the fictional sleuth Nancy Drew, whose books have been in print for nearly 100 years; and a book that traces the development of modern Egypt through the historical importance of the tomato.The grants, which total $35.6 million, will support projects at museums, libraries, universities and historic sites in 44 states, as well as in Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., and the United Arab Emirates.Another of the projects is the restoration of a strawberry farm and processing facility established by Japanese immigrants on Vashon Island, Wash., in 1926. It will soon serve as a center for public programming on Japanese immigration and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.At Vanderbilt University, oral histories from the descendants of 19th- and 20th-century residents of Nashville's Bass Street neighborhood, which was founded by Black Civil War veterans, will be collected. Funding will also go toward research for a book chronicling the history of the Girl Scouts of the USA, and its issues around race and feminism, by Amy Farrell, a women's studies professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.Shelly C. Lowe, the endowment's chairwoman, said in a statement that the projects, which include curriculum development initiatives designed to improve college and career readiness among students, "demonstrate the vitality of the humanities across our nation" and "support humanities programs and opportunities for underserved students and communities."In New York, nearly $4.9 million in grants will be distributed among 27 projects. The money, in part, will support an exhibition on 100 years of New York City history at the Museum of the City of New York; a traveling exhibition on the art and culture of Byzantine-era North and East Africa at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and research for a book about Latino monuments in the United States by Marisa Lerer, an associate professor of art history at Manhattan College.Funding will also go to researchers at Virginia Tech for the creation of a database of 17th-century court cases relating to escape attempts by enslaved and indentured laborers in the Chesapeake Bay region, as well as a grant to support a monograph on the post-prison reintegration of people convicted of genocide in Rwanda, by Hollie Nyseth Nzitatira, an associate professor of sociology at Ohio State University.

        Hollywood is getting ever closer to a shutdown.The unions representing thousands of television and movie writers said on Monday that they had overwhelming support for a strike, giving union leaders the right to call for a walkout when the writers' contract with the major Hollywood studios expires on May 1.The unions, which are affiliated East and West Coast branches of the Writers Guild of America, said more than 9,000 writers had approved a strike authorization, with 98 percent of the vote.W.G.A. leaders have said this is an "existential" moment for writers, contending that compensation has stagnated over the last decade despite the explosion of television series in the streaming era. In an email last week to writers, the lead negotiators said that "the survival of writing as a profession is at stake in this negotiation."With two weeks to go before the contract expires, there has been little sign of progress in the talks. In the email, the negotiating committee said the studios "have failed to offer meaningful responses on the core economic issues" and offered only small concessions in a few areas."In short, the studios have shown no sign that they intend to address the problems our members are determined to fix in this negotiation," the email said.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood production companies, said in a statement that a strike authorization "should come as no surprise to anyone.""A strike authorization vote has always been part of the W.G.A.'s plan, announced before the parties even exchanged proposals," the statement said. "Our goal is, and continues to be, to reach a fair and reasonable agreement." It added, "An agreement is only possible if the guild is committed to turning its focus to serious bargaining by engaging in full discussions of the issues with the companies and searching for reasonable compromises."In recent weeks, Hollywood executives have begun preparing for a strike, both by stockpiling scripts and by getting ready to produce a torrent of reality series, which do not need script writers. David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns the Warner Bros. film and TV studios as well as HBO, said at a news media event last week that he was hopeful a deal would be reached. He added that "a strike will be a challenge for the whole industry."Still, he said, the company was fully prepared if there was a walkout."We're assuming the worst from a business perspective," he said. "We've got ourselves ready. We've had a lot of content that's been produced."A strike authorization does not guarantee writers will take to the picket lines in two weeks. In 2017, a last-minute deal was struck with the studios not long after 96 percent of the writers voted to authorize a strike. The last time the writers went on strike was in 2007. That stoppage dragged for 100 days, into early 2008, and cost the Los Angeles economy an estimated $2.1 billion.If a strike begins in early May, late-night shows like "Saturday Night Live" and talk shows hosted by Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers will go dark immediately. It would take a strike of several months before viewers began to notice an effect on scripted television series and movies.The streaming era has resulted in a significant rise in the number of scripted television series that are produced, but writers say working conditions have not kept pace."Writers are working more weeks for less money," said Eric Haywood, a veteran writer and producer, and a member of the W.G.A. negotiating committee. "And in some cases, veteran writers are working for the same money or, in some cases, less money than they made just a few years ago."The timing of the talks has an added complexity given the current financial challenges for all media and entertainment companies.Over the last year, share prices for those companies have nose-dived after Wall Street began questioning why many streaming services were losing billions of dollars a year. The studios are quickly trying to make those streaming services profitable, after years of focusing primarily on growth. The shift is coming at a cost.Disney is in the midst of 7,000 job cuts. Warner Bros. Discovery, confronting a debt load of about $50 billion, shelved projects and laid off thousands of workers last year. Other media companies are taking similar cost-cutting measures.The writers do not appear to be sympathetic."The current status quo is unsustainable," Mr. Haywood said.The writers have taken particular aim at so-called minirooms. There is no one definition of a miniroom, but they have proliferated in the streaming era.In one example, the studios will convene a miniroom before a show has been picked up by a studio and scheduled to air. A small group of writers will develop a series and write several scripts over two or three months.But because the studios have not ordered the series, they will use that as justification to pay writers less than if they were in a formal writers' room, union leaders said. And given the relatively short duration of the position, those writers are then left scrambling to find another job if the show is not picked up.One union leader likened minirooms to "labor camps" during the negotiations, according to two people familiar with the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.A W.G.A. spokesman said the reference was not literal and had come during a presentation lasting an hour and a half."Development work has always been paid at a premium because you're coming up with the idea," Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator for the W.G.A., said in an interview. "If you're going to have these rooms before you pick up a show or a season, you should pay writers a premium."The writers have also said residuals - which Ms. Stutzman called "the profit participation of the middle-class writer" - have been affected in the streaming era. Before streaming, writers could receive residual payments whenever a show was licensed, whether that was for syndication, an international deal or DVD sales.But in the streaming era, as global services like Netflix and Amazon have been reluctant to license their series, those distribution arms have been cut off and replaced with a fixed residual, Ms. Stutzman said."If an overwhelming majority of the content writers create is for the streaming platforms where they are completely cut out of global growth and success, that is a very big problem," she said.

        ALBANY, N.Y. - Gov. Kathy Hochul's newest nominee to become New York State's top judge, liberal Judge Rowan Wilson, was approved by a key panel in the State Senate on Monday, paving the way for his confirmation as chief judge following months of political infighting, and for the court's potential shift to the left.Judge Wilson, 62, a prominent jurist who currently sits on the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, would become the state's first Black chief judge.If confirmed by the full Senate on Tuesday, as is widely expected, Judge Wilson's ascension could shift the political direction of the Court of Appeals, which veered to the right under the direction of the previous chief judge, Janet DiFiore. Judge Wilson, for instance, supported Democrats in their efforts, unsuccessful so far, to redraw the state's congressional districts.During his six years on the Court of Appeals, Judge Wilson built a reputation as a progressive who has defended and expanded the rights of workers, wrongfully convicted individuals and criminal defendants. Lauded as one of the court's most intellectual jurists, he has written more than 100 dissents and concurrences, and frequently voted against the conservative bloc of judges led by Ms. DiFiore.The approval Monday by the Senate Judiciary Committee came after an hourslong hearing that sharply contrasted with the contentious hearing in February for Ms. Hochul's initial nominee, Hector D. LaSalle, who was rejected by Senate Democrats following complaints from the left that he was too conservative.The rejection marked the first time that lawmakers had voted down a governor's nominee, forcing Ms. Hochul, a moderate Democrat, to put forth another candidate. She did so last week with Judge Wilson, a move that placated left-leaning Democrats who control the Senate.Judge Wilson received a relatively warm welcome on Monday from lawmakers, who praised his writing style even as they peppered him with questions about his judicial philosophy, plans to revamp the court, and about a contentious decision he recently wrote in a rape case.While Justice LaSalle's hearing was held in a spacious auditorium to accommodate a throng of protesters and supporters, Judge Wilson's was held in a cramped hearing room in the Capitol, underscoring the lack of controversy around this nomination."It is vital that we restore the court to its position of national pre-eminence and ensure that the public is confident in the court's integrity," Judge Wilson said during his opening statement. "The court's role and legitimacy is particularly important now, in the face of the U.S. Supreme Court's retreat from several of its seminal decisions."When asked by State Senator Anthony Palumbo, a Republican from Long Island, about the LaSalle dispute, which pitted Ms. Hochul against her party, Judge Wilson urged lawmakers to "move forward," adding that to delve "into this muck really ends up, I think, hurting the court system, which is the last thing I want to do."To fill the vacancy created by Judge Wilson's potential ascension, Ms. Hochul simultaneously nominated Caitlin Halligan, a private lawyer and former New York solicitor general who is seen as more moderate than Judge Wilson.Ms. Halligan, whose confirmation hearing will take place on Tuesday, could face a tougher line of questioning from Democrats over her past representation of corporate clients and work in a prosecutor's office. Even so, top Senate Democrats have already praised her qualifications, and she is also widely expected to be confirmed.Looming over her confirmation process, however, is a potential lawsuit from Senate Republicans. Along with government watchdogs, Republicans have said that a recent change in the law allowing Ms. Hochul to quickly nominate Ms. Halligan, and avoid a monthslong search for a new judge to replace Judge Wilson, is unconstitutional.Judge Wilson's elevation to chief judge would fill a post that has remained empty since Ms. DiFiore's abrupt resignation in August, which has led the remaining judges to deadlock on a number of cases over the past seven months.If confirmed, both Judge Wilson and Ms. Halligan could play a pivotal role in a Democrat-led appeal that is challenging the state's recently redrawn congressional maps. Democrats are seeking a state commission to redraw New York congressional lines that were drawn by a court-appointed expert, helping Republicans regain control of the House last year.When Ms. DiFiore helped cast the deciding vote to overthrow the Democrat-drawn congressional maps last year, Judge Wilson wrote the dissenting opinion defending the maps as constitutional. Court observers expect that Judge Wilson would rule in favor of Democrats if the appeal makes it to the Court of Appeals. Ms. Halligan would likely cast the deciding vote.Indeed, the ongoing redistricting saga has led Republicans to speculate that Democrats are focused on filling the Court of Appeals with liberal judges, primarily, to get more favorable legislative lines after suffering embarrassing losses last year.Republicans had sharp words for the new nominee. "We saw progressive leftist legislators block the nomination of the highly qualified Justice LaSalle - who would have been the first Latino Chief Justice - because they want an activist judge rather than an independent judge," said the Senate minority leader, Rob Ortt.Democrats pushed back. "Rowan Wilson gives us the chance to turn back the clock and get the court back on its historical footing of great integrity and judicial leadership," Michael Gianaris, the Democratic deputy majority leader in the State Senate, said in an interview. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Judge Wilson previously made the chief judge shortlist in 2015, when he was still a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, a prominent Manhattan law firm where he worked for three decades. But Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor at the time, instead chose Ms. DiFiore to replace the outgoing chief judge, Jonathan Lippman.Two years later, however, Mr. Cuomo nominated Mr. Wilson to fill an associate judge vacancy on the Court of Appeals. Judge Wilson did have to contend with some pointed questions on Monday about a decision he wrote last month overturning a rape conviction, leading to criticism from some Democrats, including former Representative Carolyn Maloney, who wrote on Twitter that the judge had "prioritized rapists over rape victims."Mr. Wilson stood by his opinion Monday, saying that to leave the conviction in place would have been to approve of the prosecutor's four-year delay in bringing the case, which he said was unacceptable."The victim here did everything right. What she did not deserve was the treatment at the hands of the D.A.," he said."It's a horrible feeling, and it's not an easy thing to do, but it's a function of the way our legal system is," he said, adding that, "we do not do enough to protect victims of domestic violence."

        Theodore E. McCarrick, the former Roman Catholic cardinal expelled by Pope Francis in 2019, was charged on Monday with fourth-degree sexual assault in Wisconsin. It was the second criminal complaint against a man who was once one of the most high-profile clerics in the American Catholic Church.Mr. McCarrick, now 92, is the first and only cardinal to be criminally charged in the sprawling sex abuse scandal that has consumed the church. Thousands of victims and abusers have been identified in parishes across the nation, with accusations from decades ago still being revealed in ongoing investigations.Resulting lawsuits have pushed some dioceses to file for bankruptcy. Yet relatively few criminal charges have resulted, largely because the statute of limitations has expired, though some states are changing laws to allow for civil cases to proceed.The new charge against Mr. McCarrick stems from an accusation dating back to 1977. According to the criminal complaint, Mr. McCarrick assaulted a 19-year-old that year at a home on Geneva Lake in southern Wisconsin, where they were both guests. Prosecutors say the victim was swimming off a dock when Mr. McCarrick and another adult man entered the water and fondled his genitals without his consent.The complaint states that the victim, who is unnamed, also said Mr. McCarrick sexually assaulted him on numerous other occasions and in other states, first exposing himself to the victim when he was 11. The victim, now in his 60s, claims that Mr. McCarrick would take him "to a special event or lavish party and then sexually assault" him, including one event where multiple adult men had sex with him.Mr. McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., also faces charges in Massachusetts over an accusation that he sexually assaulted a teenage boy at a wedding reception at Wellesley College in 1974.Mr. McCarrick pleaded not guilty in 2021 in that case to three counts of indecent assault and battery on a person age 14 and older. In February, his lawyers asked a judge to dismiss the case against him, saying he was not mentally competent to face trial because he had dementia.A lawyer for Mr. McCarrick, Barry Coburn, said he had no comment on the new charge or on the ongoing prosecution in Massachusetts.Mr. McCarrick was last known to be living in Missouri. The new complaint lists his address as a seminary in Maryland.Two decades since the Catholic Church abuse scandal exploded into public view after an investigation published by The Boston Globe, the many subpoenas and investigations from attorneys general offices have produced only a handful of criminal charges. The Massachusetts case was able to proceed because Mr. McCarrick was not a resident of Massachusetts at the time of the alleged abuse there. The clock on the statute of limitations stopped once he left the state, meaning it did not expire as it would have if he were a resident.The Wisconsin case follows the same playbook. The criminal complaint notes that Mr. McCarrick was not a resident of the state at the time of the alleged assault.Mr. McCarrick was once one of the most prominent clerics in the U.S. Catholic Church. Born and ordained in New York, he rose steadily through the ranks, becoming an auxiliary bishop of New York in 1977, the same year as the Wisconsin case. He was named archbishop of Washington in 2001 and was a prolific fund-raiser for the Vatican, rubbing elbows with presidents and celebrities.Cardinals hold the second-highest position in the church after the pope.Mr. McCarrick was removed from ministry in 2018 after a church investigation found that he had been credibly accused of sexually abusing a 16-year-old altar boy at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan in 1971. After a Vatican trial, Mr. McCarrick was removed from the priesthood in 2019.But some church officials had been warned about his predatory behavior for decades. A New York Times investigation in 2018 revealed settlements paid to men who had complained about Mr. McCarrick when he was a bishop in New Jersey in the 1980s. Leaders were warned repeatedly about accusations of sexual harassment including the inappropriate touching of adult seminarians.The new charge in Wisconsin stems from a report made to the Clergy and Faith Leader Abuse initiative, which the state's Justice Department started two years ago."Thank you to the brave survivors who have made reports," Josh Kaul, the attorney general of Wisconsin, said in a statement encouraging other victims to come forward with their stories.

        How do you sum up a media giant and a political visionary like Logan Roy? The day after his death, the newspapers call him "a complicated man." (Kendall's translation: "Threw phones at staff.") He was a "sharp reader of the national mood." (Roman: "He's a bit racist.") He was "very much a man of his era." (Kendall: "Again, racist. Also, relaxed about sexual assault.") As Logan's family, friends, employees and admirers gather at his home to mourn - and to plot - no one can seem to agree on who he really was. After reading yet another glowing tribute, Shiv jokes: "Dad sounds amazing. I'd like to have met Dad."Yet just when Logan's inner circle thinks that it might finally be free of his mercurial approach to business and family matters, he springs one more annoying surprise from beyond the grave. In Logan's safe, the estate's executor, Frank, finds a piece of paper from four (or more) years ago, naming Kendall as Logan's preferred successor.But there are a handwritten notes and markings on the page - including a line partially under Kendall's name and partially through it. Was Logan emphasizing that he wanted his son to take over? Or was he indicating that he definitely did not?After last week's emotionally wrenching episode, "Succession" comes back with one of the funniest of the series, filled with quotable lines and sick burns. Any feelings of sadness or sentimentality among the Roy children fades as soon as they realize Waystar's top executives - Frank, Gerri, Karl and Tom - are disappearing behind closed doors to begin what Shiv calls "a coronation demolition derby." The ensuing bumps and scrapes are perversely entertaining.On the old-timers' side, everyone speaks with a brittle politeness masking deep hostility. Gerri puts herself forward as the logical choice to be chief executive, having already done it on an interim basis. When Karl balks, she delivers a wicked backhanded compliment, saying: "You're a corporate legend. What you did in the '90s, with cable? Huge."Tom, meanwhile, insists that all he wants to do is serve, adding: "If there's a ring, my hat is in. Respectfully." To that, Karl suggests that the board might have questions about Tom, and he frames those "as a friend," saying, "You're a clumsy interloper and no one trusts you."As for the Rebel Alliance - now possibly interested in rejoining the Empire, if the pay is competitive and management positions are available - they seem initially more united. They all jump on a call to one of Lukas Mattson's lackeys, where Shiv waves away a question about which one of them is the leader, saying, "We're a pretty fluid group." But it is perhaps an ominous sign that she physically recoils after saying that. It is also not good that Mattson demands that one of the three fly out to GoJo's strategy retreat within the next 24 hours. (Shiv: "You obviously know what happened here yesterday, right?" Lackey: "Oh sure, yeah, we really feel for you guys. Bad one.")This is when Frank comes across the "rather worrying piece of paper." (It is so worrying that he wonders if maybe it could be flushed down a toilet. He and Karl then clarify that they are merely "speculating in a comic mode.") Both the old and young factions gather in an upstairs room, where Roman diminishes the document's meaning, saying to Kendall, "This thing is old, and you've tried to put him in jail, like, 12 times since then."One thing seems clear: Both the children and the Waystar executives want the GoJo sale to go through. After that, there will be no more Waystar to control and the siblings can proceed with their original plan to run Pierce Global Media together, perhaps now merged with ATN. Since the chief executive position would be temporary anyway, Kendall pounces, saying: "Anyone can do that. And since he said. …"Something about Kendall's eagerness does not sit right with Roman and Shiv, although they have trouble articulating why. Maybe it is the gleefully vicious tone he takes when he snaps that Logan's document "doesn't say Shiv." Or maybe it is the way he keeps trying to corner both of them, warning that they should not give the company away to Gerri or anybody else "just because we didn't talk."Ultimately, Roman buys the idea that the board and the markets might see Kendall's pitch for himself as "same-old but with a vibe-y new banner." And the executives come around when they realize they can package Kendall as a co-leader with Roman, who still has an official title as Waystar's chief operating officer. Shiv is cut out of this leadership group. Her brothers insist that she is still a part of an unofficial triumvirate, but while she has them make "a Dad promise, on yesterday" (referring to how they all bonded in their shock and grief), she is so upset by the mini-coup that she falls down a small set of stairs while fleeing the house.There are other power-plays afoot this week. Logan's estranged wife Marcia (Hiam Abbass) is no longer - as Kerry once said - "shopping in Milan, forever." She conspicuously positions herself as a greeter at the wake, asserting that she still spoke to her husband every day. She also refuses Kerry entry to the upstairs and has her removed from the premises, right as Kerry is gathering her personal effects and nervously babbling to Roman about Logan's big plans for her.And then there is Tom, as always treading the line between "sweetly helpful" and "snaking around." He tries to show Shiv some kindness, reminding her of when they first got together and how he flew to France to be with her. Shiv, as uncertain as the rest of us as to whether Tom is merely making a play, replies coolly, "That was a while back."It is Kendall, though, who ends the day in the lead. He and Roman entertain a pitch from Hugo and Karolina about strengthening their executive bona fides by getting it out into the press that Logan was a mentally unstable abuser who had not really been in charge of Waystar in years. Roman nixes this unequivocally. But Kendall - who knows that Hugo has some potential insider-trading trouble to bury - comes to him privately about the "Bad Dad" plan and says, "Action that, but soft … no prints."Before he meets with Hugo, Kendall is staring at a picture on his phone of Logan's sloppy succession plan - and his own crossed-out or underlined name. The old man remained inscrutable to the end, for sure. But the sickening smile on Kendall's face right before the credits roll raises questions, too. Is he smearing Logan because, as he claims, that is exactly the kind of nasty maneuver his father would pull? Or is Kendall still bent on revenge?Either way, one thing is sure: Kendall is his father's son.

        This article contains major spoilers for Episode 4 of the final season of "Succession."After the grief and anguish of last week's episode, "Succession" wasted no time in getting back to the ice-cold heart of the series: power grabbing. What else should we have expected from the day after Logan's death? The Roys are going to Roy.While the episode opened with some shots of Kendall, Roman and Shiv still in their feelings - and the revelation that Shiv is pregnant - by the end the knives were out. The "sibs" are back making moves against each other. Logan's executive team is back trying to stop them. Marcia is back from shopping in Milan. Tom and Greg, the "Disgusting Brothers," are back whispering profanities to each other in the corner of the room. We're still focused on the question: What does one even wear to a half-wake, half-business meeting?Jessica Testa: We should start by talking about Shiv, whose wardrobe so far this season has revealed a lot about her emotional state. The composed shell is cracking. Now we better understand that it isn't just the divorce. She's pregnant. Which makes her wardrobe in this episode all the more interesting, because the old Shiv is BACK.Guy Trebay: Everything was so studiously muted. And the rendering of mourning clothes was masterful, if typically off-kilter. It's a contemporary dilemma: What do you wear to mourn? A Loro Piana polo? A black suit? Jeans?Vanessa Friedman: Well, to mourn and to do battle with the board to run the company at the same time. That's a hard balancing act to pull off. The star of this episode, for me, was Shiv's houndstooth jacket. Which I think was this one by Alexander McQueen (or a very similar one, anyway).Stella Bugbee: Most of the guests milling at the house looked solemn and formal, which made the brothers look overly casual by comparison. Shiv struck a balance between the suits and the kids. Perhaps a signal that she would have been the best choice to run the company?JT: It's like she came dressed for the coronation demolition derby. And then was the first one of the siblings out of the running. But my favorite style moment was Marcia's mini mourning veil hairpiece.VF: Very Power Widow. As Shiv said, "Death becomes her."GT: Only Marcia was conventionally dressed for mourning. She was old school, and the clothes worked as unambiguous visual statements of authority.JT: Who makes a $63 million real estate deal at a funeral? Marcia!SB: Meanwhile, poor Kerry was a mess.VF: I wanted a closer look at the Kerry detritus that spilled out of the bag.GT: Lots of pills. White powder on the floor. Having her exit through the service door was grim.VF: Shiv's stilettos were spot on. So sharp, even if she tripped going down the stairs.SB: The trip was the one moment that felt a little too on the nose for me.GT: Agree, and falls usually presage miscarriage.SB: Yes, though she did get right back up. It was a costume moment that really highlighted the gender inequality at the heart of that family.GT: And of the culture. Almost without exception, the women were formally dressed, and the guys looked like they were going to lunch at the Ivy.VF: Except poor old Tom, always a pretender to the throne.JT: Here to serve!GT: I want to take five showers every time he says that. I don't know if someone can be physiologically disposed to insincerity. It's like Ben Affleck's RBF: can't help it.SB: And yet, that moment on the stairs, when he's talking about the silk shirt Shiv was wearing the first time they were together, was an exquisite bit of writing (even if it was manipulative).JT: And a reminder that these sartorial details are deeply important to the writers of this show.VF: Her journey from silk shirt to black turtleneck and buttoned jacket is sort of the story arc of their relationship. He couldn't get through all those layers if he tried.GT: Yes, and the buttoning up "Don't touch me" moment closed it out. To go back to Jess's comment, what made this episode forceful in costuming terms was the extreme restraint, where you're unconsciously directed to drill down into the details.SB: Absolutely. The episode began with the three main Roy siblings in their pajamas, each emerging from their own dark night of the soul. In the opening shot, Kendall sits on the floor in muted tones, wan and puffy faced. Cut to Roman aggressively brushing his teeth in a stark white V-neck, followed by soon-to-be-sidelined-Shiv, still under the covers. The clothes play a part in keeping the audience guessing who is up and who is down.GT: Roman had "pre-grieved," as he put it.SB: I guess we'll see how well that works out for him.

        In February, Kelsea Ballerini released a surprise EP, "Rolling Up the Welcome Mat," a set of songs inspired by her recent divorce from another country singer, Morgan Evans. It was her freshest recent work, thematically and musically, and also a reminder that for the past few years, several female country singers have found freedom in divorce-inspired music.In 2021, Carly Pearce put out "29," an EP, and later "29: Written in Stone," a full-length project, inspired by her divorce from the singer Michael Ray. That same year, Kacey Musgraves released "Star-Crossed," which followed her split from the singer Ruston Kelly. (Men have traveled this path as well - Kelly has just released an album of his own, and in 2016, both Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert reacted to their divorce with new albums.)On this week's Popcast, a conversation about how the women of country have navigated divorce as subject matter, how Nashville appears to encourage the overlap of professional obligations and personal entanglements, and the ways that personal liberation might be connected to musical liberation.Guest:

        The singer and songwriter Seal is one of modern music's most ardent believers in the power of love, but that doesn't mean you should look to him for romantic advice. "You're headed for disaster if you ask me," he joked, before immediately providing what sounded like a practical perspective on how to make a relationship work. "I've found that it's most productive when both parties see themselves, and then there's this third entity which is like a plant. That plant needs water every day, and you love that plant because you - both as an entity, and as individuals - are all that it has."This type of focused dedication was on Seal's mind as he prepared for a tour celebrating 30 years of his music career, an anniversary that prompted some reflection. "I can't believe how fortunate I am to still be here," he said in a video interview from his home studio in Los Angeles. "Every day above ground is a great day, as far as being a musician is concerned."He emphasized his good fortune, like when the film director Joel Schumacher gave new life to "Kiss From a Rose," which hadn't made any commercial impact with its 1994 arrival, by incorporating it into the 1995 film "Batman Forever." Upon rerelease, the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart and won Grammys for record and song of the year. "It was exactly the same song that failed the first time. That's a big, lucky break."But Seal, 60, isn't fixated on the past. He cited Travis Scott's 2020 performance inside the video game Fortnite as a potential model for how artists may reach fans in the future, remarking that "it won't be long before we're at a YouTube concert, virtually rubbing shoulders." Still, he's excited to see real-life fans on his tour this spring, which starts in late April. "Any time I get to play live for people, it's like going on a date for the first time," he said. "There are no bad audiences - only mediocre performances."As he prepared to hit the road, Seal spoke about 10 of his beloved cultural inspirations. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.It's always on my mind. If you've listened to my music, I've been singing about that out of the gate. Every situation is almost certainly different when you choose to lean in with love; it doesn't really matter what it is. Of course, love requires a degree of vulnerability. The ultimate kind of love - what we're trying to achieve - is unconditional. I think that's its purest form, and I also think that's the reason for our existence. This is all an experiment; the point of it is happiness. Without unconditional love, I don't know if it's possible to achieve that - certainly not on this earth.I love tennis because it's an allegory for life. I love the discipline; I love the work; I love the problem solving; I love how, in the most incredible way, it relates to singing. In order to play tennis well, you have to go against everything your body wants; you have to relax, you have to almost relinquish control. I know that's contrary to popular belief, but that's singing: You let yourself, rather than make yourself.I saw this director, Mike Figgis, at a candlelit dinner; he was taking pictures, and I was intrigued how he wasn't using a flash. The next day, I went into a store and bought the exact same setup. That's where the love affair began. It's the one camera that gets out of the way between the subject I'm trying to capture and myself. By virtue of its design, the person can still see your face when you're taking the picture; you still have that engagement and connection, opposed to the viewfinder being in the middle.One of my great memories of Joni was performing "Both Sides Now" with her in the audience. It's one of the highlights of my life, the ability to work with someone who had such an impact on your growing up. [Seal sang on Mitchell's 1994 song "How Do You Stop."] It's the stuff dreams are made of; I just remember pinching myself to make sure it was happening. She's quite remarkable; she's a great storyteller, and authentic to the core. To see her onstage singing, after everything she's been through, was amazing.She gave it to me on my birthday, and that's everything. Anyone who has a son or a daughter, when they give something to you - whether it's their love, or a valuable lesson or something like a necklace - it's not so much what it is, but the spirit and the soul of the person behind it. They start out as kids, and they end up as these people with their own outlook and philosophies on life, so the gift is more about their thought process, and who they are behind it. It's both beautiful and heartwarming - you realize they're their own people with their own views on the world, and what's important to them.I don't like to call him a designer, because he's more than that - he's an artist much in the same way that a musician or a painter is an artist. I've been wearing his clothes since he started, and I just love the way he sees things - his attention to detail in the silhouette and the shape. I can spot somebody wearing a Carol costume at 100 yards. He doesn't do bad stuff; that's why he's my favorite.It's a large part of who I am - you can take the boy out of London, but you never take London out of the boy. I like walking around where I grew up, just triggering those memories, but I also love the West End - anywhere in London, to be honest. I love my city, warts and all. It takes about two weeks of that dreadful weather to bring me to my senses and remind me why I left, but I'm lucky enough that I'm able to go back fairly regularly.To not be curious about it would be akin to being a Luddite, or an ostrich with your head stuck in the sand. It's here, and it's part of our evolution - for that reason, you can't fight it, and you can't really see it as this enemy that's going to be the end of mankind. My experience with it is I started out by thinking it was a machine, but once I started to relate to it as though I were talking to a person, this incredible collaboration started - I would ask maybe one or two questions, and it would spark my imagination and ability to create. I think it's incredible, and I think we're at an amazing point in our evolution as a species.Sometimes a melody I'm writing is in my head, but more often than not, it's on a guitar. I think handmade instruments are just beautiful things; they're transport mechanisms to convey this phenomenon known as music. I love acoustic guitars, and Goodalls are my favorite. It's all subjective - Martins are great to record with, but I'm pretty heavy-handed and Martins typically don't like when you bash them. Goodalls, you can play them loud but they're great at lower volumes, and of course the craftsmanship is extraordinary.Do I sit and meditate every day? Probably, but not in a way that you might imagine. If it's not sitting down in a kumbaya position and breathing - which I rarely do - it is playing tennis, which is a form of meditation. Having a degree of focus whilst being in a state - it's a form of meditation. The thing I enjoy most is the balance, and the slowing down of the mind. That's really important.

        Welcome to The Wordle Review. Be warned: This article contains spoilers for today's puzzle. Solve Wordle first, or scroll at your own risk.This month's featured artist is Simone Noronha. You can read more about her here.★★★★Wordle 667 4/6⬜⬜🟩⬜⬜ ADIEU⬜⬜🟩⬜⬜ STICK🟨⬜🟩⬜⬜ FRILL🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩 WHIFFForget four-letter words; who knew there were so many five letter words in the English language? It is MAGIC, CRAZY, SUPER. There are so many five-letter words that you can practically fall into all of them, like sinking into a DOWNY comforter of language and wrapping yourself in alphabetical combinations. It drives me NUTTY.In fact, try writing a sentence without a five letter word. It's harder than you MIGHT THINK. And once you START seeing them, you see them everywhere.I have OFTEN felt the game-playing WORLD is divided between crossword puzzlers and Sudoku TYPES; between THOSE who love the ebb and flow of vocabulary and meaning, and those who rise to the challenge of strategy. I have always been firmly in the former camp, but Wordle has bridged the gap, which is MAYBE why I find it both annoying and addictive.I generally SOLVE the puzzle in four TRIES, WHICH on one hand I like because it allows me to discover so many more five-letter WORDS - TANGO, which brings up MANGO, which makes me think of MELON because … FRUIT. But I also want to do it in three, or even two, because I am competitive. That doesn't happen very OFTEN. It did not happen TODAY.I started with ADIEU, which seems like a good beginning word because there are so many vowels, but often proves less than fruitful. That yielded only one letter, but at LEAST it was in the RIGHT PLACE. Then I went with STICK because I was trying to be strategic, but that only served to eliminate more letters, rather than add any winners. That seemed like karmic justice for picking a boring word, so next I tried FRILL in HONOR of my job as fashion critic. Ah! Now we were getting somewhere: one more letter, even if it was in the WRONG PLACE. Indeed, I solved it on my next try.Today's answer is kind of a fun word (try saying it 10 times fast), so I give this puzzle four out of five STARS.Today's word is WHIFF. According to Webster's New World College Dictionary, it's a noun meaning "a brief, passing odor carried in the air."Today's word is moderately challenging because of the unfamiliarity of its letter pattern.The letter pattern is unique enough that the answer can usually be found using elimination strategies within six guesses, but the word has duplicated letters, making it tricky.Here is a reminder of the answers last week.Wordle 660 Monday, April 10: UNDERWordle 661 Tuesday, April 11: QUALMWordle 662 Wednesday, April 12: BORAXWordle 663 Thursday, April 13: CARATWordle 664 Friday, April 14: THIEFWordle 665 Saturday, April 15: AGONYWordle 666 Sunday, April 16: DWELTSimone Noronha is a South Asian illustrator and art director from Dubai who is based in New York. She enjoys weaving narratives and intricate details into her imagery with saturated palettes and the moody lighting that has become her signature. In an interview with Wired, she said, "I like to think of illustrative style as just our natural flaws shining through and doing the best with it."If you solved for a word different from what was featured today, please refresh your page.Join the conversation on social media!
